0,House Dem Aide: We Didnโ€t Even See Comeyโ€s Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It,Darrell Lucus,"House Dem Aide: We Didnโ€t Even See Comeyโ€s Letter Until Jason Chaffetz Tweeted It By Darrell Lucus on October 30, 2016 Subscribe Jason Chaffetz on the stump in American Fork, Utah ( image courtesy Michael Jolley, available under a Creative Commons-BY license) 
With apologies to Keith Olbermann, there is no doubt who the Worst Person in The World is this weekโ€“FBI Director James Comey. But according to a House Democratic aide, it looks like we also know who the second-worst person is as well. It turns out that when Comey sent his now-infamous letter announcing that the FBI was looking into emails that may be related to Hillary Clintonโ€s email server, the ranking Democrats on the relevant committees didnโ€t hear about it from Comey. They found out via a tweet from one of the Republican committee chairmen. 
As we now know, Comey notified the Republican chairmen and Democratic ranking members of the House Intelligence, Judiciary, and Oversight committees that his agency was reviewing emails it had recently discovered in order to see if they contained classified information. Not long after this letter went out, Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz set the political world ablaze with this tweet. FBI Dir just informed me, ""The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation."" Case reopened 
โ€” Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) October 28, 2016 
Of course, we now know that this was not the case . Comey was actually saying that it was reviewing the emails in light of โ€an unrelated caseโ€โ€“which we now know to be Anthony Weinerโ€s sexting with a teenager. But apparently such little things as facts didnโ€t matter to Chaffetz. The Utah Republican had already vowed to initiate a raft of investigations if Hillary winsโ€“at least two yearsโ€ worth, and possibly an entire termโ€s worth of them. Apparently Chaffetz thought the FBI was already doing his work for himโ€“resulting in a tweet that briefly roiled the nation before cooler heads realized it was a dud. 
But according to a senior House Democratic aide, misreading that letter may have been the least of Chaffetzโ€ sins. That aide told Shareblue that his boss and other Democrats didnโ€t even know about Comeyโ€s letter at the timeโ€“and only found out when they checked Twitter. โ€Democratic Ranking Members on the relevant committees didnโ€t receive Comeyโ€s letter until after the Republican Chairmen. In fact, the Democratic Ranking Members didnโ€ receive it until after the Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, tweeted it out and made it public.โ€ 
So letโ€s see if weโ€ve got this right. The FBI director tells Chaffetz and other GOP committee chairmen about a major development in a potentially politically explosive investigation, and neither Chaffetz nor his other colleagues had the courtesy to let their Democratic counterparts know about it. Instead, according to this aide, he made them find out about it on Twitter. 
There has already been talk on Daily Kos that Comey himself provided advance notice of this letter to Chaffetz and other Republicans, giving them time to turn on the spin machine. That may make for good theater, but there is nothing so far that even suggests this is the case. After all, there is nothing so far that suggests that Comey was anything other than grossly incompetent and tone-deaf. 
What it does suggest, however, is that Chaffetz is acting in a way that makes Dan Burton and Darrell Issa look like models of responsibility and bipartisanship. He didnโ€t even have the decency to notify ranking member Elijah Cummings about something this explosive. If that doesnโ€t trample on basic standards of fairness, I donโ€t know what does. 
Granted, itโ€s not likely that Chaffetz will have to answer for this. He sits in a ridiculously Republican district anchored in Provo and Orem; it has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+25, and gave Mitt Romney a punishing 78 percent of the vote in 2012. Moreover, the Republican House leadership has given its full support to Chaffetzโ€ planned fishing expedition. But that doesnโ€t mean we canโ€t turn the hot lights on him. After all, he is a textbook example of what the House has become under Republican control. And he is also the Second Worst Person in the World. About Darrell Lucus

1,"FLYNN: Hillary Clinton, Big Woman on Campus - Breitbart",Daniel J. Flynn,"Ever get the feeling your life circles the roundabout rather than heads in a straight line toward the intended destination? [Hillary Clinton remains the big woman on campus in leafy, liberal Wellesley, Massachusetts. Everywhere else votes her most likely to don her inauguration dress for the remainder of her days the way Miss Havisham forever wore that wedding dress.  Speaking of Great Expectations, Hillary Rodham overflowed with them 48 years ago when she first addressed a Wellesley graduating class. The president of the college informed those gathered in 1969 that the students needed โ€no debate so far as I could ascertain as to who their spokesman was to beโ€ (kind of the like the Democratic primaries in 2016 minus the   terms unknown then even at a Seven Sisters school). โ€I am very glad that Miss Adams made it clear that what I am speaking for today is all of us โ€”  the 400 of us,โ€ Miss Rodham told her classmates. After appointing herself Edger Bergen to the Charlie McCarthys and Mortimer Snerds in attendance, the    bespectacled in granny glasses (awarding her matronly wisdom โ€”  or at least John Lennon wisdom) took issue with the previous speaker. Despite becoming the first   to win election to a seat in the U. S. Senate since Reconstruction, Edward Brooke came in for criticism for calling for โ€empathyโ€ for the goals of protestors as he criticized tactics. Though Clinton in her senior thesis on Saul Alinsky lamented โ€Black Power demagoguesโ€ and โ€elitist arrogance and repressive intoleranceโ€ within the New Left, similar words coming out of a Republican necessitated a brief rebuttal. โ€Trust,โ€ Rodham ironically observed in 1969, โ€this is one word that when I asked the class at our rehearsal what it was they wanted me to say for them, everyone came up to me and said โ€Talk about trust, talk about the lack of trust both for us and the way we feel about others. Talk about the trust bust.โ€ What can you say about it? What can you say about a feeling that permeates a generation and that perhaps is not even understood by those who are distrusted?โ€ The โ€trust bustโ€ certainly busted Clintonโ€s 2016 plans. She certainly did not even understand that people distrusted her. After Whitewater, Travelgate, the vast   conspiracy, Benghazi, and the missing emails, Clinton found herself the distrusted voice on Friday. There was a load of compromising on the road to the broadening of her political horizons. And distrust from the American people โ€”  Trump edged her 48 percent to 38 percent on the question immediately prior to Novemberโ€s election โ€”  stood as a major reason for the closing of those horizons. Clinton described her vanquisher and his supporters as embracing a โ€lie,โ€ a โ€con,โ€ โ€alternative facts,โ€ and โ€a   assault on truth and reason. โ€ She failed to explain why the American people chose his lies over her truth. โ€As the history majors among you here today know all too well, when people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,โ€ she offered. โ€That is not hyperbole. โ€ Like so many people to emerge from the 1960s, Hillary Clinton embarked upon a long, strange trip. From high school Goldwater Girl and Wellesley College Republican president to Democratic politician, Clinton drank in the times and the place that gave her a degree. More significantly, she went from idealist to cynic, as a comparison of her two Wellesley commencement addresses show. Way back when, she lamented that โ€for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible, and the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible. โ€ Now, as the big woman on campus but the odd woman out of the White House, she wonders how her current station is even possible. โ€Why arenโ€t I 50 points ahead?โ€ she asked in September. In May she asks why she isnโ€t president. The woman famously dubbed a โ€congenital liarโ€ by Bill Safire concludes that lies did her in โ€”  theirs, mind you, not hers. Getting stood up on Election Day, like finding yourself the jilted bride on your wedding day, inspires dangerous delusions.",0
2,Why the Truth Might Get You Fired,Consortiumnews.com,"Why the Truth Might Get You Fired October 29, 2016 
The tension between intelligence analysts and political policymakers has always been between honest assessments and desired results, with the latter often overwhelming the former, as in the Iraq War, writes Lawrence Davidson. 
By Lawrence Davidson 
For those who might wonder why foreign policy makers repeatedly make bad choices, some insight might be drawn from the following analysis. The action here plays out in the United States, but the lessons are probably universal. 
Back in the early spring of 2003, George W. Bush initiated the invasion of Iraq. One of his key public reasons for doing so was the claim that the countryโ€s dictator, Saddam Hussein, was on the verge of developing nuclear weapons and was hiding other weapons of mass destruction. The real reason went beyond that charge and included a long-range plan for โ€regime changeโ€ in the Middle East. President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney receive an Oval Office briefing from CIA Director George Tenet. Also present is Chief of Staff Andy Card (on right). (White House photo) 
For our purposes, we will concentrate on the belief that Iraq was about to become a hostile nuclear power. Why did President Bush and his close associates accept this scenario so readily? 
The short answer is Bush wanted, indeed needed, to believe it as a rationale for invading Iraq. At first he had tried to connect Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 attacks on the U.S. Though he never gave up on that stratagem, the lack of evidence made it difficult to rally an American people, already fixated on Afghanistan, to support a war against Baghdad. 
But the nuclear weapons gambit proved more fruitful, not because there was any hard evidence for the charge, but because supposedly reliable witnesses, in the persons of exiled anti-Saddam Iraqis (many on the U.S. governmentโ€s payroll ), kept telling Bush and his advisers that the nuclear story was true. 
What we had was a U.S. leadership cadre whose worldview literally demanded a mortally dangerous Iraq, and informants who, in order to precipitate the overthrow of Saddam, were willing to tell the tale of pending atomic weapons. The strong desire to believe the tale of a nuclear Iraq lowered the threshold for proof . Likewise, the repeated assertions by assumed dependable Iraqi sources underpinned a nationwide U.S. campaign generating both fear and war fever. 
So the U.S. and its allies insisted that the United Nations send in weapons inspectors to scour Iraq for evidence of a nuclear weapons program (as well as chemical and biological weapons). That the inspectors could find no convincing evidence only frustrated the Bush administration and soon forced its hand. 
On March 19, 2003, Bush launched the invasion of Iraq with the expectation was that, once in occupation of the country, U.S. inspectors would surely find evidence of those nukes (or at least stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons). They did not. Their Iraqi informants had systematically lied to them. 
Social and Behavioral Sciences to the Rescue? 
The various U.S. intelligence agencies were thoroughly shaken by this affair, and today, 13 years later, their directors and managers are still trying to sort it out โ€“ specifically, how to tell when they are getting โ€trueโ€ intelligence and when they are being lied to. Or, as one intelligence worker has put it, we need โ€ help to protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen. โ€ To that end the CIA et al. are in the market for academic assistance. Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a key supplier of Iraqi defectors with bogus stories of hidden WMD. 
A โ€partnershipโ€ is being forged between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), which serves as the coordinating center for the sixteen independent U.S. intelligence agencies, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine . The result of this collaboration will be a โ€ permanent Intelligence Community Studies Boardโ€ to coordinate programs in โ€social and behavioral science research [that] might strengthen national security .โ€ 
Despite this effort, it is almost certain that the โ€social and behavioral sciencesโ€ cannot give the spy agencies what they want โ€“ a way of detecting lies that is better than their present standard procedures of polygraph tests and interrogations. But even if they could, it might well make no difference, because the real problem is not to be found with the liars. It is to be found with the believers. 
The Believers 
It is simply not true, as the ODNI leaders seem to assert, that U.S. intelligence agency personnel cannot tell, more often than not, that they are being lied to. This is the case because there are thousands of middle-echelon intelligence workers, desk officers, and specialists who know something closely approaching the truth โ€“ that is, they know pretty well what is going on in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Israel, Palestine and elsewhere. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper (right) talks with President Barack Obama in the Oval Office, with John Brennan and other national security aides present. (Photo credit: Office of Director of National Intelligence) 
Therefore, if someone feeds them โ€snake oil,โ€ they usually know it. However, having an accurate grasp of things is often to no avail because their superiors โ€“ those who got their appointments by accepting a pre-structured worldview โ€“ have different criterion for what is โ€trueโ€ than do the analysts. 
Listen to Charles Gaukel, of the National Intelligence Council โ€“ yet another organization that acts as a meeting ground for the 16 intelligence agencies. Referring to the search for a way to avoid getting taken in by lies, Gaukel has declared, โ€ Weโ€re looking for truth. But weโ€re particularly looking for truth that works. โ€ Now what might that mean? 
I can certainly tell you what it means historically. It means that for the power brokers, โ€truthโ€ must match up, fit with, their worldview โ€“ their political and ideological precepts. If it does not fit, it does not โ€work.โ€ So the intelligence specialists who send their usually accurate assessments up the line to the policy makers often hit a roadblock caused by โ€group think,โ€ ideological blinkers, and a โ€we know betterโ€ attitude. 
On the other hand, as long as what youโ€re selling the leadership matches up with what they want to believe, you can peddle them anything: imaginary Iraqi nukes, Israel as a Western-style democracy, Saudi Arabia as an indispensable ally, Libya as a liberated country, Bashar al-Assad as the real roadblock to peace in Syria, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) aka Star Wars, a world that is getting colder and not warmer, American exceptionalism in all its glory โ€“ the list is almost endless. 
What does this sad tale tell us? If you want to spend millions of dollars on social and behavioral science research to improve the assessment and use of intelligence, forget about the liars. What you want to look for is an antidote to the narrow-mindedness of the believers โ€“ the policymakers who seem not to be able to rise above the ideological presumptions of their class โ€“ presumptions that underpin their self-confidence as they lead us all down slippery slopes. 
It has happened this way so often, and in so many places, that it is the source of Shakespeareโ€s determination that โ€what is past, is prelude.โ€ Our elites play out our destinies as if they have no free will โ€“ no capacity to break with structured ways of seeing. Yet the middle-echelon specialists keep sending their relatively accurate assessments up the ladder of power. Hope springs eternal.",1
3,15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified,Jessica Purkiss,"Videos 15 Civilians Killed In Single US Airstrike Have Been Identified The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations.   Photo of Hellfire missiles being loaded onto a US military Reaper drone in Afghanistan by Staff Sgt. Brian Ferguson/U.S. Air Force. 
The Bureau has been able to identify 15 civilians killed in a single US drone strike in Afghanistan last month โ€“ the biggest loss of civilian life in one strike since the attack on the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital (MSF) last October. 
The US claimed it had conducted a โ€counter-terrorismโ€ strike against Islamic State (IS) fighters when it hit Nangarhar province with missiles on September 28. But the next day the United Nations issued an unusually rapid and strong statement saying the strike had killed 15 civilians and injured 13 others who had gathered at a house to celebrate a tribal elderโ€s return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. 
The Bureau spoke to a man named Haji Rais who said he was the owner of the house that was targeted. He said 15 people were killed and 19 others injured, and provided their names (listed below). The Bureau was able to independently verify the identities of those who died. 
Raisโ€ son, a headmaster at a local school, was among them. Another man, Abdul Hakim, lost three of his sons in the attack. 
Rais said he had no involvement with IS and denied US claims that IS members had visited his house before the strike. He said: โ€I did not even speak to those sort of people on the phone let alone receiving them in my house.โ€ 
The deaths amount to the biggest confirmed loss of civilian life in a single American strike in Afghanistan since the attack on the MSF hospital in Kunduz last October, which killed at least 42 people. 
The Nangarhar strike was not the only US attack to kill civilians in September. The Bureauโ€s data indicates that as many as 45 civilians and allied soldiers were killed in four American strikes in Afghanistan and Somalia that month. 
On September 18 a pair of strikes killed eight Afghan policemen in Tarinkot, the capital of Urozgan provice. US jets reportedly hit a police checkpoint, killing one officer, before returning to target first responders. The use of this tactic โ€“ known as a โ€double-tapโ€ strike โ€“ is controversial because they often hit civilian rescuers. 
The US told the Bureau it had conducted the strike against individuals firing on and posing a threat to Afghan forces. The email did not directly address the allegations of Afghan policemen being killed. 
At the end of the month in Somalia, citizens burnt US flags on the streets of the north-central city of Galcayo after it emerged a drone attack may have unintentionally killed 22 Somali soldiers and civilians. The strike occurred on the same day as the one in Nangarhar. 
In both the Somali and Afghan incidents, the US at first denied that any non-combatants had been killed. It is now investigating both the strikes in Nangarhar and Galcayo. 
The rate at which civilians are being killed by American airstrikes in Afghanistan is now higher than it was in 2014 when the US was engaged in active combat operations. Name",1

An Iranian woman has been sentenced to six years in prison after Iranโ€s Revolutionary Guard searched her home and found a notebook that contained a fictional story sheโ€d written about a woman who was stoned to death, according to the Eurasia Review . 
Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, 35, is the wife of political prisoner Arash Sadeghi, 36, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence for being a human rights activist, the publication reported.

6,"Life: Life Of Luxury: Elton Johnโ€s 6 Favorite Shark Pictures To Stare At During Long, Transcontinental Flights",nan,"Ever wonder how Britainโ€s most iconic pop pianist gets through a long flight? Here are the six pictures of sharks Sir Elton John likes to stare at to pass the time on an airplane. 1. A Shark Swimming 
Sit next to Elton John on a flight and youโ€ll see a man living in the lap of luxury, as he immediately tapes this photo of a shark darting through the ocean over his window to stare at throughout the trip. The platinum-selling artist has been known to pull his window shade down to make the shark disappear, and then quickly retract it to mark the animalโ€s triumphant return. He will often repeat this act dozens of times per flight. 2. A Great White Shark Leaping Into The Air 
When youโ€re an international pop sensation worth an estimated $450 million, people go the extra mile to make you happy. Flight crews are instructed to place this photo of a breaching great white in Elton Johnโ€s seat-back pocket before he even boards the plane. The five-time Grammy winner loves to pull the image out at his leisure to stare at while flying, sometimes holding it a mere 3-to-4 inches away from his face while he fixates upon the sharkโ€s beady eyes. 3. A Shark On The Prowl 
Rumor has it Elton John first acquired this shark photo in 1997, just before flying to London to perform โ€Candle In The Windโ€ at Princess Dianaโ€s funeral. Itโ€s been a staple of his travel routine ever since. Those who have flown with the music legend say that Sir Elton turns on every single overhead light in his row to study this picture with a magnifying glass. 4. Two Hammerhead Sharks 
How does the man behind โ€Tiny Dancerโ€ and โ€Rocket Manโ€ handle turbulence as his plane traverses the Atlantic? Once that โ€Fasten Seat Beltsโ€ sign lights up, this picture of two hammerhead sharks comes out. Elton John holds the photo in a tight vice grip and stares straight at it until the turbulence passes, often without blinking for minutes at a time. 5. The Poster For Jaws 
Sir Elton John absolutely adores the poster for Steven Spielbergโ€s Jaws and hopes to one day see the film. In the meantime, the British icon makes do by slowly unfolding his 24-by-36-inch copy of the poster whenever heโ€s on a long flight, gently tracing the sharkโ€s teeth with his finger as he stares lovingly into its gaping mouth. 6. Pilotโ€s Choice 
As much as Elton relishes in the calming regularity of his shark picture rotation, he also loves the excitement of gazing upon a totally unexpected shark when flying from London to a distant corner of Europe. Thatโ€s why all pilots who fly Sir Elton print out a shark picture of their choice from their home computers before going to the airport, and hand it to the visibly excited musician prior to takeoff. So yeahโ€”itโ€s good to be Elton!",1
7,Benoรฎt Hamon Wins French Socialist Partyโ€s Presidential Nomination - The New York Times,Alissa J. Rubin,"PARIS  โ€”   France chose an idealistic, traditional   candidate in Sundayโ€s primary to represent the Socialist and   parties in the presidential election this spring. The candidate, Benoรฎt Hamon, 49, who ran on the slogan that he would โ€make Franceโ€s heart beat,โ€ bested Manuel Valls, the former prime minister, whose campaign has promoted more   policies and who has a strong    background. Mr. Hamon appeared to have won by a wide margin, with incomplete returns showing him with an estimated 58 percent of the vote to Mr. Vallsโ€s 41 percent. โ€Tonight the left holds its head up high again it is looking to the future,โ€ Mr. Hamon said, addressing his supporters. โ€Our country needs the left, but a modern, innovative left,โ€ he said. Mr. Hamonโ€s victory was the clearest sign yet that voters on the left want a break with the policies of President Franรงois Hollande, who in December announced that he would not seek  . However, Mr. Hamonโ€s strong showing is unlikely to change widespread assessments that   candidates have little chance of making it into the second round of voting in the general election. The first round of the general election is set for April 23 and the runoff for May 7. The Socialist Party is deeply divided, and one measure of its lack of popular enthusiasm was the relatively low number of people voting. About two million people voted in the second round of the primary on Sunday, in contrast with about 2. 9 million in the second round of the last presidential primary on the left, in 2011. However, much of the conventional wisdom over how the elections will go has been thrown into question over the past week, because the leading candidate, Franรงois Fillon, who represents the main   party, the Republicans, was accused of paying his wife large sums of money to work as his parliamentary aide. While nepotism is legal in the French political system, it is not clear that she actually did any work. Prosecutors who specialize in financial malfeasance are reviewing the case. Franceโ€s electoral system allows multiple candidates to run for president in the first round of voting, but only the top two   go on to a second round. Mr. Hamon is entering a race that is already crowded on the left, with candidates who include   Mรฉlenchon on the far left, and Emmanuel Macron, an independent who served as economy minister in Mr. Hollandeโ€s government and who embraces more   policies. Unless he decides to withdraw, Mr. Fillon, the mainstream right candidate, will also run, as will the extreme right candidate Marine Le Pen. The two have been expected to go to the runoff. Mr. Hamonโ€s victory can be attributed at least in part to his image as an idealist and traditional leftist candidate who appeals to union voters as well as more environmentally concerned and socially liberal young people. Unlike Mr. Valls, he also clearly distanced himself from some of Mr. Hollandeโ€s more unpopular policies, especially the economic ones. Thomas Kekenbosch, 22, a student and one of the leaders of the group the Youth With Benoรฎt Hamon, said Mr. Hamon embodied a new hope for those on the left. โ€We have a perspective we have something to do, to build,โ€ Mr. Kekenbosch said. Mr. Hollande had disappointed many young people because under him the party abandoned ideals, such as support for workers, that many   voters believe in, according to Mr. Kekenbosch. Mr. Hollandeโ€s government, under pressure from the European Union to meet budget restraints, struggled to pass labor code reforms to make the market more attractive to foreign investors and also to encourage French businesses to expand in France. The measures ultimately passed after weeks of strikes, but they were watered down and generated little concrete progress in improving Franceโ€s roughly 10 percent unemployment rate and its nearly 25 percent youth joblessness rate. Mr. Hamon strongly endorses a stimulus approach to improving the economy and has promised to phase in a universal income, which would especially help young people looking for work, but would also supplement the livelihood of   French workers. The end goal would be to have everyone receive 750 euros per month (about $840). โ€We have someone that trusts us,โ€ Mr. Kekenbosch said, โ€who says: โ€I give you enough to pay for your studies. You can have a scholarship which spares you from working at McDonaldโ€s on provisional contracts for 4 years. โ€ Mr. Hamon advocates phasing out diesel fuel and encouraging drivers to replace vehicles that use petroleum products with electrical ones. His leftist pedigree began early. His father worked at an arsenal in Brest, a city in the far west of Brittany, and his mother worked off and on as a secretary. He was an early member of the Movement of Young Socialists, and he has continued to work closely with them through his political life. He also worked for Martine Aubry, now the mayor of Lille and a former Socialist Party leader.",0
8,Excerpts From a Draft Script for Donald Trumpโ€s Q&ampA With a Black Churchโ€s Pastor - The New York Times,nan,"Donald J. Trump is scheduled to make a highly anticipated visit to an   church in Detroit on Saturday, the first such visit of his campaign. There, he will participate in a    session conducted by Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of the church, Great Faith Ministries International. Given the importance of the visit, the Trump team went so far as to script Mr. Trumpโ€s answers to Bishop Jacksonโ€s questions, which were submitted in advance. After this article was published on Thursday night, a campaign official said that Mr. Trump would also speak to the churchโ€s congregation and then tour some neighborhoods with Ben Carson, a former presidential candidate and Detroit native. Below are excerpts from a draft of the script that was obtained by The New York Times. _____ Mr. Trump there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over. Case and point Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their Bible Study and slaughtered the Reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a race war. What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our Country? In the Bible Jesus said that a house divided cannot stand. Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a   society. In business, we hire, retain and award based on merit. In society, however, we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country. We have to reform our tax system so that we can spur economic growth for the long haul. We have to have stronger enforcement of immigration laws. We have to renegotiate our trade deals so that we can bring advantage back to the American workforce. But perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all Americans. The higher the educational attainment, the greater the likelihood one can climb the economic ladder. We must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get rid of Common Core. We must make sure that access, affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system. Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American, we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained. Republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done. We have to have the courage to go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that our children have access to the whatever educational situation they may need. This is not something one person can do, but it is something that we can do together. _____ Mr. Trump there is a perception that your administration is racist. With many of the African American voters their belief is that the Republican Party as a whole does not cater to African American needs. In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney and neither one of them came to Detroit, or any urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community. First I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican Candidate. Second I need to know how would you change that perception in our community? The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. Coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. We need to be true to our word and offer all Americans more opportunities so that each and every one of them can reach their full potential. This means economic policies that will bring jobs back to America and will raise wages for all. This means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children. This means cleaning up drugs and making our neighborhoods and communities safer. We need to get people off welfare and back to work. We need to make sure that anyone who qualifies can go into a bank, get a loan and then start a business. We need to reduce regulations and expand options for people who want to be independent of government. We need to make sure that people can worship how they want and where they want without worrying that some federal agency is going to threaten the religious liberties. Republicans have better options. We just need to have the courage to present them with conviction. _____ Mr. Trump what is your vision for America? And specifically Black America? If you repeal Obama care what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who canโ€t afford it, yet need it the most? As President, I must serve all Americans without regard to race, ethnicity or any other qualification. I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential. If we are to Make America Great Again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country. I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. Every individual, regardless of race or ethnicity, must have access to the full array of opportunities in America. My vision for America is that every citizen and legal resident of this nation will be able to stand side by side and be proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth. As for the Affordable Care Act, I will work to repeal the act and replace it with market driven solutions that will offer more access to healthcare at more affordable prices. Every American should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines, have health savings account that belong to them, have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best prices and know that they will not have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they are in this country illegally. We want to block grant Medicaid so that states can provide services closer to the people. We want to make sure that every American has great economic opportunity so that they can seek out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it. This approach will serve all Americans and will ensure that more Americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options. _____ Mr. Trump I am a registered Democrat but I am an undecided voter in this election for 2016. It is not only myself but there has been a lot of Pastors and African Americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for. The latest polls indicate that you have 1 percent of the African American vote. What can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the African American Community that will win our vote on November 8, 2016? And beyond winning, why is the African American vote important to you? All votes are important to me and my campaign. Your vote, your neighborโ€s vote, the vote of every American is critical and I must do all I can to make sure you know that if you vote for me, you are voting for a stronger, more vibrant America. My policies offer you a clear choice. You can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that, unfortunately, includes far too many people of color. If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential. This is all about opportunity  โ€”   not   outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize. The progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all Americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible. Education, jobs, religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that I will keep, not just utter to gain favor. If you are interested in a greater America with more opportunity, liberty and prosperity, you must take a chance and walk over to my side. If you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down. By the way, my support is now up to 8% and climbing.",0
9,"A Back-Channel Plan for Ukraine and Russia, Courtesy of Trump Associates - The New York Times",Megan Twohey and Scott Shane,"A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the presidentโ€s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trumpโ€s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trumpโ€s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  โ€”   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  โ€”   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. โ€Who doesnโ€t want to help bring about peace?โ€ Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  โ€”   โ€names of companies, wire transfersโ€  โ€”   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. โ€A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,โ€ Mr. Artemenko said. โ€But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?โ€ Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraineโ€s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko โ€is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. โ€ At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against โ€appeasementโ€ of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trumpโ€s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraineโ€s expense  โ€”   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenkoโ€s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trumpโ€s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russiaโ€s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossierโ€s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraineโ€s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trumpโ€s campaign. โ€Itโ€s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,โ€ he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. โ€Our time has come!โ€ Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  โ€”   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. โ€It is a gross violation of the Constitution,โ€ he said in written answers to questions from The Times. โ€Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. โ€ The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenkoโ€s project also includes the dissemination of โ€kompromat,โ€ or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trumpโ€s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenkoโ€s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater โ€were sitting in the room right now,โ€ Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, โ€I really wouldnโ€t know what he looked like. โ€ But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trumpโ€s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. โ€I want to stop a war, number one,โ€ he said. โ€Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. โ€ After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. โ€Fraud is never good, right?โ€ Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynnโ€s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.",0
10,Obamaโ€s Organizing for Action Partners with Soros-Linked โ€Indivisibleโ€ to Disrupt Trumpโ€s Agenda,Aaron Klein,"Organizing for Action, the activist group that morphed from Barack Obamaโ€s first presidential campaign, has partnered with the   Indivisible Project for โ€online trainingsโ€ on how to protest President Donald Trumpโ€s agenda. [Last week, Breitbart News extensively reported that Indivisible leaders are openly associated with groups financed by billionaire George Soros.  Politico earlier this month profiled Indivisible in an article titled, โ€Inside the protest movement that has Republicans reeling. โ€  The news agency not only left out the Soros links, but failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisibleโ€s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire, as Breitbart News documented. Organizing for Action (OFA) is a   community organizing project that sprung from Obamaโ€s 2012 campaign organization, Organizing for America, becoming a nonprofit described by the Washington Post as โ€advocate[ing] for the presidentโ€s policies. โ€ In a recent Facebook post titled, โ€Take a deep breath. Then take action,โ€ OFA called on constituents to lobby particularly hard between now and February 26, when lawmakers will be in their home districts. The post included a link to a guide released by Indivisible on how to organize against Trump. โ€Stay tuned for online trainings and invitations to calls with coalition partners like Indivisible Guide,โ€ the OFA post states. Paul Sperry, writing at the New York Post, relates: The manual, published with OFA partner โ€Indivisible,โ€ advises protesters to go into halls quietly so as not to raise alarms, and โ€grab seats at the front of the room but do not all sit together. โ€ Rather, spread out in pairs to make it seem like the whole room opposes the Republican hostโ€s positions. โ€This will help reinforce the impression of broad consensus. โ€ It also urges them to ask โ€hostileโ€ questions  โ€”   while keeping โ€a firm hold on the micโ€  โ€”   and loudly boo the the GOP politician if he isnโ€t โ€giving you real answers. โ€ โ€Express your concern [to the eventโ€s hosts] they are giving a platform to   authoritarianism, racism, and corruption,โ€ it says.   โ€ฆ    โ€Even the safest [Republican] will be deeply alarmed by signs of organized opposition,โ€ the document states, โ€because these actions create the impression that theyโ€re not connected to their district and not listening to their constituents. โ€ Sperry reported OFA โ€plans to stage 400 rallies across 42 states this year to attack Trump and Republicans over ObamaCareโ€s repeal. โ€ Earlier this month, NBC News reported on OFAโ€s new actions and its partnership with Indivisible: OFA has hired 14 field organizers in states home to key senators as part of its campaign to defend Obamaโ€s signature healthcare law. To run that campaign, the group hired Saumya Narechania  โ€”   the former national field director at Enroll America, which worked to sign people up for Obamacare  โ€”   and a deputy campaign manager.   โ€ฆ    OFA says more than 1, 800 people have applied to its Spring Community Engagement Fellowship, a   training program,   of whom have not previously been involved with OFA. And the group has teamed up with Indivisible, a buzzy newcomer to the progressive movement, to offer organizing training that began Thursday night with a video conference. A combined 25, 000 people have registered to participate in those trainings, OFA said. Indivisibleโ€s DC branch was implicated in a scuffle last week that reportedly injured a    staffer for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( ) as well as reportedly knocking a    to the ground.  Protesters claimed they were only delivering Valentineโ€s Day cards. Indivisible is a part of a coalition of activist groups slated to hold a massive   Tax March in Washington and at least 60 other locations on April 15. Unreported by the news media is that most of the listed partners and support organizers of the march are openly financed by Soros or have close links to Soros financing, as Breitbart News documented last week. Meanwhile, earlier this month, Politico profiled Indivisible and reported that โ€conservativesโ€ are โ€spreading unfounded rumorsโ€ that the group is โ€being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros. โ€ Politico, however, seemingly failed to do even the most minimal research on the Indivisible leaders cited in the news outletโ€s own profile.  Some of those personalities are openly associated with groups financed by Soros. Politico further failed to note that the organizations cited in its article as helping to amplify Indivisibleโ€s message are either financed directly by Soros or have close ties to groups funded by the billionaire. Citing Angel Padilla, a   of the group, Politico reported: Dubbed โ€Indivisible,โ€ the group launched as a way for Padilla and a handful of fellow   aides to channel their   heartbreak into a manual for quashing President Donald Trumpโ€s agenda. They drafted a   protest guide for activists, full of pointers on how to bird dog their members of Congress in the language of Capitol insiders. The manual has since been downloaded over one million times. Indivisible says on its website that over 4, 500 local groups across the nation have โ€signed up to resist the Trump agenda in nearly every congressional district in the country. โ€ The manual has been utilized to form the basis of a protest movement. The groupโ€s website states: โ€Whatโ€s more, you all are putting the guide into action โ€”  showing up en masse to congressional district offices and events, and flooding the congressional phone lines. Youโ€re resisting โ€”  and itโ€s working. โ€ Politico reported on โ€unfoundedโ€ rumors being spread about Sorosโ€s involvement with Indivisible (emphasis added by this reporter): Its handful of senior leaders count about 100 contributors to their national organizing work but insist that all are working on a volunteer basis. They know conservatives are spreading unfounded rumors that their success is being driven by wealthy donors like George Soros, which they flatly deny. That paragraph was followed by the following quote from   Padilla (emphasis again added by this reporter): โ€It doesnโ€t matter who we take money from  โ€”   weโ€re always going to get blamed as a Soros group, even if we donโ€t take money from Soros,โ€ said Padilla, now an analyst with the National Immigration Law Center. โ€Thatโ€s one of the attacks and thatโ€s fine. โ€ While โ€Indivisibleโ€ has yet to disclose its donors, Politico failed to inform readers that the National Immigration Law Center where the news outlet reported Padilla serves as an analyst is financed by Sorosโ€s Open Society Foundations. The Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. Also unmentioned by Politico is that Padilla previously served as an immigration policy consultant at the radical National Council of La Raza. Soros is a major La Raza donor. Politico went on to detail how Indivisible has been aided by MoveOn. org and the ACLU.  The news website failed to tell readers that MoveOn. org and the ACLU are both financed by Soros, a relevant tidbit given Politicoโ€s claim about โ€unfounded rumorsโ€ that Indivisiblesโ€ success was being driven by Soros .  The news website reported: In addition, MoveOn. org and the Working Families Party joined with Indivisible for its first nationwide call on Jan. 22. Nearly 60, 000 people phoned in that day, according to Levin and MoveOn organizing director Victoria Kaplan. Indivisible estimates that its second national call, on the impact of Trumpโ€s immigration order with assistance from the ACLU and Padillaโ€s group, drew 35, 000 people. Politico also missed that, according to its Twitter account, another organizer of the conference call with MoveOn. org was the International Refugee Assistance Project, a project of the Urban Justice Center, another recipient of an Open Society grant. Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Centerโ€s International Refugee Assistance Project, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Sorosโ€s Open Society Foundations. Politico further reported on Indivisibleโ€s ties to the organizers of last monthโ€s   Womenโ€s March while failing to mention that Soros reportedly has ties to more than 50 โ€partnersโ€ of that march. Also, this journalist first reported on the march leadersโ€ own close associations with Soros. Regarding Indivisible and the Womenโ€s March, Politico reported: Indivisible is also embracing collaboration with other major   protest outlets. Leaders of the group were in communication with Womenโ€s March organizers before their main event on Jan. 21, and that partnership will become official when the March unveils the third in its series of 10 direct actions that attendees have been asked to pursue in their communities. Another Indivisible leader mentioned in the Politico article is Jeremy Haile. Not reported by Politico is that is Haile served as federal advocacy counsel for the Sentencing Project.  The Sentencing Project is reportedly financed by Sorosโ€s Open Society Foundations, which has also hosted the Project to promote its cause.

12,Russian Researchers Discover Secret Nazi Military Base โ€Treasure Hunterโ€ in the Arctic [Photos],Amando Flavio,"The mystery surrounding The Third Reich and Nazi Germany is still a subject of debate between many observers. Some believe that Nazi Germany, under the control of Adolf Hitler, possessed supernatural powers, and largely employed pseudo-science during the 1933-1945 period. However, some also hold that the above belief is just a mere speculation without any proven fact. Over the years, researchers have searched extensively for answers to some of the more mysterious activities associated with Nazi Germany.
Nazi Germany invaded Russia (formerly the USSR) during the Second World War on June 22, 1941. At the time, the German army progressed deep into Russian territory, gaining ground close to the capital Moscow, before the Russians could counter-attack, eventually driving the Nazis back.
During the Nazi occupation in Russia, in 1942, the Nazis built a secret military base around the Arctic, code-named โ€Schatzgraberโ€ or โ€Treasure Hunter,โ€ which was reportedly very instrumental in the war against Russia. The base was primarily used as a tactical weather station for planning the strategic movements of Nazi troops, warships and submarines. The base also housed eminent Nazi scientists, whom conducted many experiments to help progress a German win of the war. It was widely speculated at the time that the Nazis used the base to contact aliens or extraterrestrial beings. The controversial Ahnenerbe was even linked to the base. The Ahnenerbe was an institute in Nazi Germany. Responsible for researching archaeological and cultural history of the Aryan race, it is rumored to have had heavy occult influences. Founded on July 1, 1935, by Heinrich Himmler, Herman Wirth and Richard Walther Darrรฉ, the Ahnenerbe later conducted experiments and launched expeditions in attempts to prove that mythological Nordic populations had once ruled the world.
However, the Nazis abandoned the base in 1944 โ€“ a time when the Russian army began its offensive, pushing the Germans out of the country. According to a war-time story, supplies had dwindled to dangerously low levels, and the Nazi officers stationed at the base outpost were forced to kill and eat polar bear, which ultimately, was infected with trichinosis. This caused those stationed at the base to fall severely ill and eventually they required rescue by a German U-boat. Despite Russian authors telling the story of โ€Treasure Hunter,โ€ some observers consider it a myth, doubting its existence.
But Russian researchers have now announced that โ€Treasure Hunterโ€ has been discovered, saying the base is on the island of Alexandra Land in the Arctic Circle, located 620 miles from the North Pole.
A senior researcher at the Russian Arctic National Park, Evgeny Ermolov said in a statement announcing the discovery : โ€Before it was only known from written sources, but now we also have real proof.โ€",1
13,US Officials See No Link Between Trump and Russia,Jason Ditz,"Clinton Campaign Demands FBI Affirm Trump's Russia Ties   
With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaignโ€s allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D โ€“ NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret โ€explosiveโ€ evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. 
FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say theyโ€ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. 
The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming โ€everyone knowsโ€ that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBIโ€s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they havenโ€t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. 
The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didnโ€t stop Clinton from calling Trump a โ€puppetโ€ of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Fridayโ€s FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. 
With Clintonโ€s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that wonโ€t be happening.  ",1

15,"In Major League Soccer, Argentines Find a Home and Success - The New York Times",Jack Williams,"Guillermo Barros Schelotto was not the first Argentine player to set foot on a Major League Soccer field. Statistically speaking, he was the 28th when he made his debut for the Columbus Crew in 2007. But Schelottoโ€s phone still rings to this day, more than six years after he left the league, with calls from fellow Argentines looking for advice. Though Schelotto, 43, is currently the coach of Boca Juniors, the most decorated team in Argentina, most of the players who call him want to talk about other teams, about other countries, about a soccer world away from the   environment of Buenos Aires. โ€Most of them like to talk about the cities,โ€ Schelotto said. Many of them find a way to come. Argentines now make up the   demographic in M. L. S. trailing only Americans.

S. will start the season with at least one Argentine on their roster, a list that includes stars like Dallasโ€s Mauro Diaz and Montrealโ€s Ignacio Piatti and newcomers like Atlantaโ€s Hector Villalba and New York City F. C.โ€s Maxi Moralez. Why do they come? For some itโ€s the money, or at least the promise that it will be paid regularly. Others come for the lifestyle, the chance to fade into a comparative anonymity unavailable to them at home, or to live the โ€quiet, cleanโ€ life that Schelotto describes as he reminisces about his days in Ohio. The Portland Timbers playmaker Diego Valeri was one such player who called Schelotto, his former manager, and he eventually heeded his advice. But he said it was for an entirely different reason. A year before he signed with Portland, while under contract to his hometown club Lanus, Valeri had had a gun pressed to his throat when robbers attempted to steal his BMW with his wife, Florencia, and daughter, Connie, inside. โ€After that moment,โ€ Valeri said with considerable understatement, โ€we thought about opportunities to play outside and know different places in the world. โ€ Within a year, Valeri, who had had loan spells in Portugal and Spain, was on his way to Portland. โ€Situations like that are very hard for the Argentinian people to change,โ€ he said. The    Valeri and his family are now settled in the Northwest, where he is playing arguably the best soccer of his career. He is a     and in between was named the most valuable player when Portland won the 2015 M. L. S. Cup championship game. โ€I think they like the anonymity and the tranquillity here,โ€ Caleb Porter, Valeriโ€s coach with the Timbers, said of his star and his countrymen. โ€They really relish the opportunity to be here and to live a lifestyle thatโ€s different to how they lived in Argentina. They transition well into M. L. S. โ€ Since 2011, Portland has signed six Argentines, including its   acquisition of Blanco, 28. Valeri has been a good ambassador  โ€”   he speaks English and urges newcomers to try to learn it as soon as possible, to ease the transition. But Porter and the Timbersโ€ general manager and president of soccer, Gavin Wilkinson, believe there is another, more straightforward reason for Argentinaโ€s outsize presence in M. L. S.: It simply produces the kind of technical player that the league desires. โ€Certain countries produce certain positions more,โ€ Porter said. โ€Most teams are looking for that creative piece, and you know you can get one in Argentina. โ€ A large alumni directory and strong ties to agents and consultants in the region have made that kind of shopping easier for M. L. S. teams, and in the past the struggles of the Argentine economy also favored North American clubs, some said. But there also has been a change in the kind of individual looking to make the move north, and that has dovetailed with the leagueโ€s overall transfer policy. As the quality of M. L. S. has improved as it enters its third decade, its teams have looked less for marketability from its imports  โ€”   which in the past had trended toward aging, often European stars  โ€”   and more toward onfield impact and value. The latest class of Argentines reflects this shift, as they enter a league where the average age of designated players  โ€”   the teamโ€s   stars  โ€”   has fallen below 28, its lowest point in a decade. โ€They know that M. L. S. is different to 10 years ago,โ€ said Schelotto, who was 34 when he moved to the league. โ€They can go, make good money, play with some pressure. They know they can make a career in the United States and then maybe move to Europe. โ€Ten years ago, it was impossible. Right now, you can. โ€ There are currently 24 Argentines playing in the league. Atlanta United and its Argentine coach, Tata Martino, brought in three ahead of its first season, each of them 25 or younger (Villalba is just 22). Buying young is now seen as more of a benefit to clubs than a risk, as players who continue to develop retain a   value if they move on to brighter prospects in Europe. โ€People are coming here younger and younger, maybe to start their careers,โ€ Ignacio Piatti, a    playmaker for the Montreal Impact, said through an interpreter. โ€Itโ€s what they are looking for at that age: being able to live a comfortable life off the field and focus on their games. โ€ Piatti, like Schelotto, has been happy to offer advice to the next wave of Argentine talents considering entering M. L. S. including players on both sides of the Hudson River. Gonzalo Veron, 27, of the Red Bulls, and Moralez, 30, who recently signed with New York City F. C. both acknowledged that they had turned to Piatti for advice before signing. At a community event in East Harlem last week, Moralez  โ€”   who spent four years in Italy  โ€”   reflected on his decision to move to the United States. He had never been to New York City before signing, he said, and after turning to the likes of Piatti and David Villa for advice about the leagueโ€s standard of play, he said he also sought assurances for his family, who are set to join him in New York shortly. โ€First off, I just want to enjoy football,โ€ Moralez said. โ€But also to get to know the beauty of the city and the country. Not everybody gets the opportunity to come here. โ€",0
16,Wells Fargo Chief Abruptly Steps Down - The New York Times,Michael Corkery and Stacy Cowley,"The scandal engulfing Wells Fargo toppled its chairman and chief executive on Wednesday, as John G. Stumpf announced his departure from the company, effective immediately. The move was a swift and stunning fall for an executive whose bank made it through the 2008 financial crisis relatively unscathed, only to be undone by a   sales scandal that pervaded its community banking division and percolated under the surface for years. It was an extraordinary moment even in the banking industry, which has been bedeviled by criticism and regular scandals since the financial crisis. Despite the industryโ€s many troubles, relatively few banking chiefs have stepped down under outside pressure. But Wells Fargoโ€s transgressions were unusually blatant and straightforward, which contributed to the   public outcry. This time, there were no exotic financial instruments, complicated trades or complex mortgage trickery. The bankโ€s misdeeds were fundamentally simple: Under intense pressure to meet aggressive sales goals, employees created sham accounts using the names  โ€”   and sometimes, the actual money  โ€”   of the bankโ€s real customers. And in some cases the customers did not discover the activity until they started accumulating fees. The reaction to the fake accounts at Wells Fargo, and to Mr. Stumpfโ€s response to what has been uncovered as a widespread problem, has been withering and unrelenting. Wells Fargo has been under fire from irate customers, regulators, lawmakers and former employees since last month, when it disclosed that it would pay $185 million in fines and penalties over the unauthorized creation of as many as two million bank and credit card accounts over a period of at least five years by branch employees who were said to be under intense pressure to hit ambitious product sales goals. The sales practices may reach back far longer. Former bank employees told The New York Times of concerns they raised internally as far back as 11 years ago. Mr. Stumpf, 63, who was twice called in front of Congress to testify about the scandal in recent weeks, faced vocal demands to resign from an outraged public, but the timing of his departure was unexpected given that the Wells Fargo board had not completed its internal investigation into the phony accounts and that the bank reports   earnings on Friday. He potentially walks away with millions of dollars, including a $20 million pension, as of Wednesday, another $4. 3 million in deferred compensation, plus stock worth $109 million, according to data from Equilar. As the scandal erupted, Mr. Stumpf, who grew up on a dairy and poultry farm in Minnesota and had long emphasized his folksy roots, was unable to quell the uproar. Rather, he often seemed to inflame it. During his testimony in front of Congress, Mr. Stumpf said he took responsibility for the problems, but would not admit that there anything wrong with the bankโ€s broader culture. When pressed repeatedly by members of the Senate Banking Committee about why he had not given back any of his lavish compensation, Mr. Stumpf insisted that the decision was not up to him, but to the bankโ€s board. He was reminded that he was the boardโ€s chairman. One senator on the banking committee noted that criticism of the Wells Fargo scandal was one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans had agreed on in a long time. Mr. Stumpfโ€s spent 34 years at a bank that had once been regarded as a darling on Wall Street because of its ability to churn out profits even as other banks struggled. Mr. Stumpf was named chief executive in 2007 and was one of the countryโ€s   bankers, earning about $19 million last year. He was named the 2013 Banker of the Year by the trade publication American Banker. Wells Fargo was once the most valuable bank as measured by the price of its stock, which attracted the billionaire Warren E. Buffett as its largest shareholder. Mr. Buffettโ€s company, Berkshire Hathaway, has a stake of about 10 percent. Mr. Buffett did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. Wells Fargo has since ceded the most valuable bank distinction to JPMorgan Chase. The board received a letter from Mr. Stumpf early on Wednesday indicating that he intended to retire, according to a person briefed on the matter. This person said the board was still in the early stages of conducting its investigation into the fake accounts and Mr. Stumpfโ€s handling of the scandal and had not drawn any conclusions from its inquiry. The board was not scheduled to meet on Wednesday when it received Mr. Stumpfโ€s letter, which this person described as brief and lacking any indication as to why the longtime C. E. O. decided to leave now. Top bank executives were expecting that Mr. Stumpf would address analysts and investors  โ€”   as he has always done  โ€”   when Wells Fargo reports its   results on Friday. Wells Fargo said Mr. Stumpf would be replaced by Timothy J. Sloan, its president and chief operating officer. Just two days earlier, the San Francisco bank shuffled its top management to give more responsibility to Mr. Sloan. โ€I am grateful for the opportunity to have led Wells Fargo,โ€ Mr. Stumpf said in a written statement. โ€While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside. โ€ Mr. Sloan was informed early Wednesday that he was the bankโ€s new C. E. O. though he had known for several days that Mr. Stumpf was preparing to step down. In an interview, Mr. Sloan said Mr. Stumpf had told him of his decision to retire after concluding that he would most likely continue to be the focus of much of the criticism being leveled at the bank. โ€It was an incredibly selfless decision,โ€ Mr. Sloan said. Federal regulators and the Los Angeles city attorney began looking into the issue in 2013. The deal Wells Fargo announced last month to settle cases brought by their offices was intended to resolve the matter, but it instead opened the floodgates, provoking a furious outpouring of questions, criticism and new information about what former employees say was a   culture of toxic sales pressure. The Department of Justice and Labor Department opened their own inquiries. Mr. Sloan said the bank had already named a new head of community banking, ended the retail banking sales goals that employees blamed for putting them under undue pressure and extended its review of its sales practices back to 2009. Originally, the bankโ€s review covered its activities only between 2011 and 2015. Mr. Sloan will not hold the dual of roles of chief executive and chairman as Mr. Stump had. Mr. Stumpf agreed last month to surrender stock grants valued at $41 million  โ€”   another highly unusual move on Wall Street, where clawback provisions have been widely adopted but are almost never deployed. Mr. Stumpf said he would give up his $2. 8 million annual salary for the duration of the boardโ€s investigation. Because his departure is a resignation, Mr. Stumpf will leave without any severance, according to Oscar Suris, a company spokesman. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who blasted Mr. Stumpf when he appeared before the Senate last month, fired off a scathing statement on Wednesday. โ€As I said at the hearing last month, Mr. Stumpf should resign, return every nickel he made while this scam was going on, and face an investigation by the Justice Department and S. E. C. ,โ€ she said. โ€So far, heโ€s one for three. โ€",0
17,Anonymous Donor Pays $2.5 Million To Release Everyone Arrested At The Dakota Access Pipeline,Starkman,"A Caddo Nation tribal leader has just been freed after spending two days behind bars in North Dakota. Family members say she was simply an innocent bystander in a clash between police and protesters, and was not guilty of anything the police claimed. 
Via AlternativeNews 

Jessi Mitchell, of local News 9 reports that โ€family members of Caddo Nation chairwoman Tamara Francis-Fourkiller said an anonymous donor paid $2.5 million late Saturday afternoon to release everyone arrested on Thursday at the Dakota Access Pipeline site.โ€
They added, however, that Francis-Fourkiller was never supposed to have been arrested in the first place. โ€An expert on sacred burial grounds , Francis-Fourkiller was one of the tribal leaders visiting the Sioux of Standing Rock to advise them during negotiations with the Dakota Access Pipeline construction team,โ€ Mitchell continues. โ€Remains were being desecrated in this pipeline, so they had asked a bunch of people to come up there, so thereโ€s a big conference,โ€ Francis-Fourkillerโ€s sister Loretta Francis explained.
On the visit , Francis said her sister and other leaders decided to tour the protest camps. They never thought they would wind up in jail. Francis said her sister had no access to her medication while in custody in Cass County, North Dakota, and now faces charges of conspiracy and rioting. โ€Part of my family was removed on the Trail of Tears and they came here to Oklahoma and they suffered,โ€ said Francis. โ€I always feel like each generation โ€“ our parents, our grandparents โ€“ try to make it better for the next generation and they certainly didnโ€t want this for my sister.โ€
Dozens of Native Americans from Oklahoma tribes had gathered Saturday afternoon at the state Capitol, according to Mitchell, with the purpose of voicing their โ€anger at the treatment of the protesters in North Dakota, pointing out this weekโ€s acquittal of armed protesters at an Oregon wildlife refuge earlier this year.โ€
โ€Weโ€re not holding guns. Weโ€re not armed, and when we see the military right here in the US use that on us, itโ€s shameful,โ€ Comanche Nation tribal council member Sonya Nevaquaya explained.
One of the fundamentals of all Native American tribes is the protection of the land. Chanting โ€Water is life!โ€ Saturday, the Oklahoma demonstrators hope to rally people from around the country to stand with those in North Dakota and stop construction on the pipeline project. โ€These pipelines, you hear of a lot of bursts and leaks and it contaminating the waters. What happens when all of our waters and resources are gone?โ€ Nevaquaya explained. Francis-Fourkiller says she will be traveling back to her home in Norman as soon as possible.

18,FBI Closes In On Hillary!,The Doc,"FBI Closes In On Hillary! Posted on Home ยป Headlines ยป World News ยป FBI Closes In On Hillary! 
We now have 5 separate FBI cases probing the Hillary-Bill Clinton inner circle. Here is the background on those 5 cases and all of the major players that we are going to cover: 

FIVE INVESTIGATIONS UNDERGOING BY THE FBI ON CLINTON, THE CLINTON FOUNDATION AND INNER CIRCLE/TRUMP SURPASSES CLINTON IN THE POLLS/DEUTSCHE BANK STOCK PLUMMETS AGAIN/DBโ€S CHIEF ECONOMIST BLASTS THE ECB AGAIN: THEY MUST BE HURTING!/569,000 OZ ADDED TO THE SLV/2.67 TONNES ADDED TO THE GLD 
Gold closed at $1306.40 up $20.40 
silver closed at $18.66 or up 47 cents. 
Access market prices: THE DAILY GOLD FIX REPORT FROM SHANGHAI AND LONDON 
. 
The Shanghai fix is at 10:15 pm est and 2:15 am est 
The fix for London is at 5:30 am est (first fix) and 10 am est (second fix) 
Thus Shanghaiโ€s second fix corresponds to 195 minutes before Londonโ€s first fix. 
And now the fix recordings: 
Shanghai morning fix Nov 2 ( 10:15 pm est last night): $ 1294.53 
NY ACCESS PRICE: $1289.70 (AT THE EXACT SAME TIME) 
Shanghai afternoon fix: 2: 15 am est (second fix/early morning):$ 1296.08 
NY ACCESS PRICE: 1291.70 (AT THE EXACT SAME TIME/2:15 am) 
HUGE SPREAD TODAY!! 4 dollars 

London Fix: Nov 2: 5:30 am est : $1295.85 (NY: same time: $1296.10: 5:30AM ) 
London Second fix Nov 2: 10 am est : $1303.75 (NY same time: $1301.75 , 10 AM ) 
Shanghai premium in silver over NY: 59 cents. 
It seems that Shanghai pricing is higher than the other two , (NY and London). The spread has been occurring on a regular basis and thus I expect to see arbitrage happening as investors buy the lower priced NY gold and sell to China at the higher price. This should drain the comex. 
Also why would mining companies hand in their gold to the comex and receive constantly lower prices. They would be open to lawsuits if they knowingly continue to supply the comex despite the fact that they could be receiving higher prices in Shanghai.

19,Chuck Todd: โ€BuzzFeed Did Donald Trump a Political Favorโ€ - Breitbart,Jeff Poor,"Wednesday after   Donald Trumpโ€s press conference at Trump Tower in New York City, NBC โ€Meet the Pressโ€ moderator Chuck Todd expressed his exasperation over the normalcy of what he called a โ€circusโ€ surrounding Trumpโ€s event.  โ€I was struck big picture wise which is of how normal a circus is now to us,โ€ Todd said. โ€This was a circus. Weโ€ve never seen a   a transition like we saw today where the press conference gets interrupted, you have a lawyer in here. The lawyer does half legal talk, half political spin. Iโ€ve never seen that, using the lawyer to say heโ€s here to make America great again, and by the way Iโ€m going to play constitutional lawyer. I donโ€t think this but clearly a constitutional lawyer told us we better not accept any of this money. So they made that exception. So I am struck at how normal crazy looked to us today. This was just a crazy scene, but this is the norm of Donald Trump. And in fact, this is where heโ€s most comfortable. And I will say this. just as a political show. if youโ€re Donald Trump, you want these press conferences because it made the press look disjointed, unorganized, all this stuff. And his people, you know, he just, it was a performance for his supporters and his people. โ€ Later in the segment, Todd decried what he saw as elements within the intelligence community being at odds with one another, then called a story put out by BuzzFeed a night earlier suggesting Trump had ties to Russia to be a โ€political favor. โ€ โ€Look, letโ€s be honest here,โ€ Todd said. โ€Politically BuzzFeed did Donald Trump a political favor today by doing what they did by going ahead and making it all public because it allowed them to deny a specific without having to deal with the bigger picture. โ€ Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor",0
20,News: Hope For The GOP: A Nude Paul Ryan Has Just Emerged From An Ayahuasca Tent With Visions Of A New Republican Party,nan,"Email 
Since Donald Trump entered the election over a year ago, he has single-handedly destroyed the GOP, leaving both the House and the Senate in utter disarray. But although many political strategists believe permanent damage has been done, conservatives shouldnโ€t lose hope yet, because Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has just emerged fully nude from an ayahuasca tent with visions of a new Republican Party. 
A fresh GOP platform requires fresh leadership, and when Speaker Ryan journeyed to South America last week to embark on an immersive psychedelic vision quest of political rebirth, he just proved heโ€s the only one for the job. 
After traveling to Peru and entering a makeshift tent with nothing but a towel, 200 mg of DMT, and a bucket to vomit in, Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) spent the last 12 hours lying nude on the jungle floor, enduring bursts of vivid consciousness in which he watched the secrets of a unified, more moderate GOP unfold before his very eyes. 
While under the influence of the powerful psychedelic, ancient spiritual guides appeared before the congressman, instructed him to remove his clothes, and held him down as lifelike projections of Republican leaders twisted and contorted around him until the perfect cabinet had revealed itself amid infinite realities in which tax cuts and fiscal budgets exploded into cacophonous symphonies, all to create a Republican Party that mobilizes key voter constituencies. 
Check out these tweets he posted just a few moments after emerging nude from his tent in the Amazon rain forest! 
Whoa. Democrats have been pretty confident this past year, but if Paul Ryanโ€s visions of the Republican party are right, they better watch out! 
Say what you want about Paul Ryan, but heโ€s a man who refuses to give up. On the one hand, is it possible that the speakerโ€s grand ayahuasca visions of a new Republican Party are just a temporary fix? Sure. But on the other hand, if he plays his cards right, his proposals could have an even larger impact than they did during the thousands of years he lived while trapped inside his own mind. 
One thing is for sure: Paul Ryan emerged fully nude from that ayahuasca tent with a new perspective, and people are starting to take notice.",1
21,"Monica Lewinsky, Clinton Sex Scandal Set for โ€American Crime Storyโ€",Jerome Hudson,"Screenwriter Ryan Murphy, who has produced the   FX series American Crime Story, is set to bring the Monica   Clinton White House sex saga to TV. [According to the Hollywood Reporter, the Ryan Murphy Productions chief has optioned author and CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Tobinโ€s 2000 book A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President.  The New York Times bestseller, acquired by Fox 21 Television Studios and FX Productions, will become the basis for a future American Crime Story season. In February, Murphy told E! News that the series would explore the Lewinsky sex scandal as โ€ โ€ plot to โ€tear downโ€ President Bill Clinton, and on โ€the other womenโ€ who were ensnared in the 1996 sex scandal, involving   House intern Monica Lewinsky, and the events that led to Clintonโ€s impeachment. โ€Itโ€s not really about Hillary Clinton. That book is about the rise of a certain segment of a   group of people who despised the Clintons and used three women, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp to try and tear him down,โ€ Murphy said. In February, Murphy announced that actress Sarah Paulson  โ€”   who starred in the first season of his crime drama, The People vs. O. J. Simpson  โ€”   has been confirmed for a role, but ruled out that it would be of   Lady Hillary Clinton. The    mogul has reportedly confirmed that his studio is looking actresses to portray Lewinsky and Tripp. Season two of the Golden Globe and Primetime Emmy   show will tackle Hurricane Katrina, and is set to premier in 2018. Season three, he confirmed will focus on the 1997 assassination of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace, singer Ricky Martin has already joined the cast.

22,Rob Reiner: Trump Is โ€Mentally Unstableโ€ - Breitbart,Pam Key,"Sunday on MSNBCโ€s โ€AM Joy,โ€ actor and director Rob Reiner accused President Donald Trump of being โ€mentally unstable. โ€  Reiner said, โ€Itโ€s scary, itโ€s scary, because if you look at the capacity that cyber warfare has, and if you know about Stuxnet, which some people do and donโ€t know about that, they were able to weaponize, you know, a cyber warfare and actually go in and blow up centrifuges in Iran.

23,Massachusetts Copโ€s Wife Busted for Pinning Fake Home-Invasion Robbery on Black Lives Matter,nan,"Massachusetts Copโ€s Wife Busted for Pinning Fake Home-Invasion Robbery on Black Lives Matter   Source: PINAC 
The wife of a Massachusetts cop is facing charges for filing a false police report after she concocted a story about thieves ransacking her home, stealing $10,000 in jewelry and then spray-painting her house with Black Lives Matter to pin it on black people. 
Maria Daly, wife of Millbury K-9 cop Daniel Daly, took to social media about her dreamt-up victimization after she filed a police report on October 17. 
โ€We woke up to not only our house being robbed while we were sleeping, but to see this hatred for no reason,โ€ she posted, according to the Boston Herald. 
โ€ If you would of [sic] asked me yesterday about this blue lives and black lives matter issue my response would of [sic] been very positive [sic],โ€ the now private Facebook account alleged. โ€Today on the other hand I have so much anger and hate that I donโ€t like myself. This is what we have to deal with these days and it makes me sick that this is what was on the side of my house.โ€ 
Maria Daly called police to report someone had robbed her home while she was sleeping and then spray-painted her home with BLM for Black Lives Matter then posted about it on social media. 
Millbury Police Chief Donald Desourcy told the Herald that Daly called police to report an early morning break-in October 17, claiming someone had made off with thousands of dollars worth of valuables and spray-painting โ€BLMโ€ on the outside of her house. 
But Chief Desourcy stated that as the investigation unfolded, something didnโ€t feel โ€quite rightโ€ and Daly ended up admitting she fabricated the whole thing, telling the officers her valuables had already been recovered. 
โ€It was pretty obvious. The officers did their due diligence and followed through with the investigation that we had,โ€ he told CBS Boston . โ€We came to the conclusion it was all fabricated. There was no intruder, there was no burglary.โ€ 
The chief said the hoax was likely motivated by the coupleโ€s financial troubles and that he has empathy for the family. 
โ€Iโ€m very familiar with her and itโ€s an unfortunate set of circumstances that have taken place.โ€ 
Dalyโ€s neighbors said it wasnโ€t a very smart thing to do for a woman who is married to a cop. 
โ€She must have tagged the place herself,โ€ said one neighbor. 
โ€I donโ€t know why youโ€d do that, if youโ€re gonna stage a robbery, I mean really come on, youโ€re a copโ€s wife. You should know better.โ€ 
In addition to charges for filing a false police report, Daly also faces a charge for misleading a police investigation. Her cases will be heard at Worcester District Court after she is summoned. 
Dalyโ€s husband, Daniel Daly was not involved or charged in relation to the hoax, according to police. Share This Article...",1
24,Abortion Pill Orders Rise in 7 Latin American Nations on Zika Alert - The New York Times,Donald G. McNeil Jr. and Pam Belluck,"Orders for abortion pills by women in seven Latin American countries with Zika outbreaks increased after health officials in those countries warned that the virus might cause severe birth defects, according to a womenโ€s organization supplying such pills. Orders from women in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela roughly doubled, while those from Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras went up by from 36 percent to 76 percent, researchers said in a study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. The authors of the study included a leader of the group based in Amsterdam that is supplying the pills, Women on Web, a nonprofit staffed by doctors helping women from countries where abortion is illegal or restricted to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Even with the increase in demand for abortion pills, the number of orders received by Women on Web from Latin America and the Caribbean in that time period was small: slightly more than 2, 300 in the region, with about 1, 600 of those in countries where health authorities had warned about Zikaโ€s potential to cause brain damage. In the countries where Zika warnings were issued, there are typically about 3. 5 million abortions per year, said Gilda Sedgh, the principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization which was not involved in the study. So, Dr. Sedgh said, โ€The increase in demand for abortion observed by the authors in countries affected by Zika could be spurious because Women on Web accounts for a small share of all abortions in that part of the world. โ€ The numbers could be โ€an early warning signโ€ of increased demand for abortion because of Zika, Dr. Sedgh said, adding that it is also possible that Women on Web โ€might have experienced an increase in demand as a result of increased visibility of their services when health advisories were issued. โ€ Access to abortion has been a contentious issue for years in many of the countries affected by Zika, but Zika has brought fresh attention to the debate. In Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a recent study, there are about 6. 5 million abortions each year. Most of them are illegal, and an estimated 750, 000 women a year are treated for complications from unsafe abortions in the region, Dr. Sedgh said. Womenโ€s rights groups have long pressed for abortion restrictions to be eased. The study looked at orders for pills between Nov. 17, 2015, when the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert saying Zika virus might be linked to a surge in infants born with tiny heads and damaged brains in Brazil, and March 2 of this year. It compared actual orders to the number that would have been expected based on orders during the previous five years. Women on Web has a history of defying legal restrictions in such countries, which sometimes block access to its website or seize the packages it sends. The nonprofit also asks women unable to pay for their prescription to write an email explaining why they needed the abortion pill and could not afford it. โ€Some of the emails that came in were heartbreaking,โ€ said Dr. Abigail R. A. Aiken, a reproductive health researcher at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, and the lead author of the study. โ€The fear and desperation was really hard to read. โ€ A woman from Venezuela wrote, โ€I contracted Zika 4 days ago,โ€ adding: โ€I love children. But I donโ€t believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer. I need an abortion. I donโ€t know who to turn to. Please help me ASAP!โ€ An email from a woman in Colombia said, โ€Here Zika is a major problem and the health authorities do not help with it. โ€ She added: โ€I have no resources at this time and want to ask for your help because fear overwhelms me. What if the baby is born sick? !โ€ Even more than it has increased attention on restrictive abortion laws, the Zika crisis has highlighted the issues of access to contraception and ways that women are   about birth control or discouraged from using it in some of the countries. In the face of Zika, some countries have been working to increase the availability and use of contraception. Women on Web is an offshoot of Women on Waves, which was founded in 1999 by Dr. Rebecca Gomperts. Women on Waves originally sailed a Dutch boat to countries that outlawed abortion, took women on board and performed abortions outside a nationโ€s territorial waters. As internet access in poor countries increased, Dr. Gomperts began supplying mifepristone and misoprostol pills, a combination approved by the World Health Organization for abortion in the first 10 weeks of a pregnancy. The Women on Web site is posted in five languages and tops Google search results for โ€I need an abortion. โ€",0
25,Nukes and the UN: a Historic Treaty to Ban Nuclear Weapons,Ira Helfand,"Email 
In an historic move the United Nations First Committee voted Thursday to convene a conference next March to negotiate a new treaty to ban the possession of nuclear weapons. The vote is a huge step forward in the campaign to rid the world of nuclear weapons launched several years ago by nonnuclear weapons states and civil society from across the globe. 
Dismayed by the failure of the nuclear weapons states to honor their obligation under Article VI of the Non Proliferation Treaty which requires them to pursue good faith negotiations for the elimination of their nuclear arsenals, and moved by the growing danger of nuclear war, more than 120 nations gathered in Oslo in March of 2013 to review the latest scientific data about the catastrophic consequences that will result from the use of nuclear weapons. The conference shifted the focus of international discussion about nuclear war from abstract consideration of nuclear strategy to an evaluation of the medical data about what will actually happen if these weapons are used. It was boycotted by all of the major nuclear powers, the US, Russia, UK, China and France, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, or P5. 
Further meetings in Nayarit, Mexico and Vienna followed in 2014 and culminated in a pledge by the Austrian government to โ€close the gapโ€ in international law that does not yet specifically outlaw the possession of these weapons. More than 140 countries ultimately associated themselves with the pledge which was fiercely opposed by the United States and the other nuclear weapons states, and in the fall of 2015 the UN General Assembly voted to establish an Open Ended Working Group which met in Geneva earlier this year and recommended the negotiations approved Thursday. 
The United States, which led the opposition had hoped to limit the โ€Yesโ€ vote to less than one hundred, but failed badly. The final vote was 123 For, 38 Against and 16 Abstentions. The โ€Noโ€ votes came from the nuclear weapons states, and US allies in NATO, plus Japan, South Korea and Australia which have treaty ties to the US and consider themselves to be under the protection of the โ€US nuclear umbrellaโ€. 
But four nuclear weapons states broke ranks, with China, India and Pakistan abstaining, and North Korea voting in favor of the treaty negotiations. In addition, the Netherlands defied intense pressure from the rest of NATO and abstained, as did Finland, which is not a member of NATO but has close ties with the alliance. 
Japan which voted with the US against the treaty has indicated that it will, nonetheless, participate in the negotiations when they begin in March. 
The US and the other nuclear weapons states will probably try to block final approval of the treaty conference by the General Assembly later this fall, but, following Thursdayโ€s vote, it appears overwhelmingly likely that negotiations will begin in March, and that they will involve a significant majority of UN member states, even if the nuclear states continue their boycott. 
The successful completion of a new treaty will not of itself eliminate nuclear weapons. But it will put powerful new pressure on the nuclear weapons states who clearly do not want to uphold their obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty even as they insist that the nonnuclear weapons states meet theirs. 
We have come perilously close to nuclear war on multiple occasions during the last 70 years, and we have been incredibly lucky. US nuclear policy cannot continue to be the hope that we will remain lucky in the future. We need to join and lead the growing movement to abolish nuclear weapons and work to bring the other nuclear weapons states into a binding agreement that sets out the detailed time line for eliminating these weapons and the detailed verification and enforcement mechanisms to make sure they are eliminated. 
This will not be an easy task, but we really have no choice. If we donโ€t get rid of these weapons, someday, perhaps sooner rather than later, they will be used and they will destroy human civilization. The decision is ours.

26,EXCLUSIVE: Islamic State Supporters Vow to โ€Shakeโ€ the West Following Manchester Terrorist Massacre - Breitbart,Aaron Klein and Ali Waked,"JERUSALEM  โ€”   Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated last nightโ€s deadly terrorist massacre at a crowded concert in Manchester, England, with the jihadists vowing to continue the onslaught against the West. [The Islamic State claimed that a โ€soldier of the caliphate planted bombs in the middle of Crusaders gatherings,โ€ apparently taking credit for the carnage.  Breitbart Jerusalem obtained access to correspondence posted in a closed chat group that utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service. The chat group serves as an internal Twitter of sorts for IS jihadists and sympathizers, and it has been used in the past to issue IS communications. A militant named Abu Ayman Alalmani (the German) wrote, โ€Thanks to Allah who allowed this achievement of the Mujahedeen. We are all believers in Allah that our brothers, the supporters and the Mujahedeen, are those who committed the attack among the infidels. We swear to Allah that the infidel countries in the West wonโ€t have the luxury of security. This is a Godly promise and this is the promise of the Mujahedeen, the future will prove to you that you are the countries of heresy. You will see this and not only hear it. โ€ An account titled โ€Muslim Justiceโ€ wrote, โ€Allah is great, Allah is great, we will shake the infidel and criminal regimes. We will destroy the rule of those who abandon Islam [a reference to Arab leaders]. Allah is great, this is a call that will rise high on the horizon and we will yet defeat the cross and the countries of infidels. โ€ ISIS member Abu Abdullah Alsury (the Syrian) wrote, โ€Thanks to Allah who caused the faithful to rejoice, we ask and request of Allah that this blessed act will be part of the battle of our brothers, the lone wolves roaming across all parts of the infidel nations, as they seek this type of blessed attack. This is part of the work and this is part of the revenge. Those infidel states will pay a heavy price. โ€ Prior to the Islamic State claiming credit for the attack, another militant, Alqaqaa Alidlebi from Idlib, wrote, โ€Weโ€re waiting for our brothers in the official media department to publish what should warm our hearts with an official declaration of responsibility, even if this isnโ€t an organized act. โ€ โ€We pray to Allah that the attacker is a faithful Muslim. You arenโ€t aware of the huge happiness here in the ranks of the Mujahedeen and their families in the district of Elkheir (the area of Dir Azzur on the border between Syria and Iraq).

27,Humiliated Hillary Tries To Hide What Camera Caught 15 Mins Before Rally,Amanda Shea,"Humiliated Hillary Tries To Hide What Camera Caught 15 Mins Before Rally Posted on October 27, 2016 by Amanda Shea in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton outside rally (left), Fox News catching incident on live feed (right) 
Both presidential candidates stopped in the battleground state of Florida this week to campaign for votes to crowds at separate locations. However, things didnโ€t go so well for Hillary Clinton, who was humiliated when a camera caught what she immediately tried to hide to save her campaign โ€” which backfired big time. 
While Donald Trumpโ€s 15,000-person army of โ€Deplorablesโ€ were holding down the fort in Stanford, Florida as they listened to this great leader explain how he plans to make America great again, Hillary was at a much smaller venue at Palm Beach State College. Although she was feeling pretty good about herself with having a higher turnout than sheโ€s used to, the approximate 1,000 to 2,000 attendees paled in comparison to what Trump was looking at in the same state. However, Hillaryโ€s anemic crowd was enough to be publicly mocked in front of. 
Perhaps Hillary didnโ€t think anyone would notice, but Fox Business Network was watching โ€” and commenting โ€” live. With just fifteen minutes before the Democratic candidate was set to take the stage in one of her final and most important rallies, the small room should have been jam-packed with people. As the humored hosts noted on the news show, that was far from the case. 
โ€Here it is nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump, 15,000. Thereโ€s maybe a thousand to two thousand people here today,โ€ one host pointed out much to Hillaryโ€s embarrassment. โ€The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see thereโ€s empty space here and sheโ€s supposed to speak in 15 minutes. And I can tell you that as the camera pans across that if we were at a Trump rally this would absolutely be packed,โ€ the commentators added. 
No matter how far ahead in the polls Hillary and her lapdog media says she is, the attendance at her events speaks volumes. Nobody cares or is enthusiastic enough about this woman to bother showing up, and those who do have to be coached on how to chant and act excited. 
On the other hand, there are Trumpโ€s rallies, where so many people turn up to venues four times the size as Hillaryโ€s that these massive stadiums canโ€t contain everyone who is eager to come, and some are turned away. If the turnout at the rallies is any indicator of whatโ€s expected at the polls, Hillary canโ€t win, and if she does, Americans should definitely question how that could even happen",1
28,Andrea Tantaros of Fox News Claims Retaliation for Sex Harassment Complaints - The New York Times,Jim Dwyer,"Andrea Tantaros, a former Fox News host, charged in a lawsuit filed Monday that top executives at the network, including the man who replaced Roger Ailes, punished her for complaining about sexual harassment by Mr. Ailes. The suit by Ms. Tantaros, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, is the latest round in a contentious volley that began in late winter, when Fox claimed she had breached her employment contract by writing a book without receiving network approval. โ€Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a   Playboy   cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny,โ€ Ms. Tantarosโ€s suit says. Fox News said it would not comment on pending litigation. Mr. Ailes, the networkโ€s founding chairman and guiding force for two decades, resigned last month after a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, said in a suit that she was fired for refusing his sexual advances. Mr. Ailes has denied all allegations of harassment. In April, the chief lawyer for Fox charged that Ms. Tantaros had concocted sexual harassment claims to gain leverage in the contract dispute her lawyer, Judd Burstein, said the book dispute was a pretext that Fox was using to silence her. During arbitration, Mr. Burstein said, Fox News offered to pay her a sum โ€in the seven figuresโ€ if she renounced claims against Mr. Ailes and others at the network, including the host Bill Oโ€Reilly. According to the lawsuit, Ms. Tantaros said she had been subjected to unwelcome advances from Mr. Oโ€Reilly, whom she had regarded as a friend and adviser. โ€Ailes did not act alone,โ€ the lawsuit states. โ€He may have been the primary culprit, but his actions were condoned by his most senior lieutenants, who engaged in a concerted effort to silence Tantaros by threats, humiliation and retaliation. โ€ Ms. Tantaros also claimed in the lawsuit that she was the subject of humiliating posts by pseudonymous accounts on Twitter known as โ€sock puppetsโ€ that she says were instigated by the Fox News publicity department. Ms. Tantaros joined Fox as a contributor in 2010, and a year later was named   of โ€The Five,โ€ which aired at 5 p. m. She said in the suit that she was repeatedly told by Fox executives that she could not wear pants on the air because โ€Roger wants to see your legs. โ€ The lawsuit goes on to say that on Aug. 12, 2014, Mr. Ailes called her into his office and asked if she was planning to marry and have children. โ€Ailes then started complaining about marriage in general, and also made   jokes about being married,โ€ the lawsuit states. It describes Mr. Ailes as speculating on the sexual habits and preferences of 10 Fox News personalities. He asked Ms. Tantaros to turn around โ€so I can get a good look at you,โ€ the lawsuit charges, adding that Ms. Tantaros refused. Soon after, she was moved from โ€The Fiveโ€ to a   show, โ€Outnumbered,โ€ that aired at midday. Mr. Ailes called her back for similar sessions in December 2014 and February 2015, the lawsuit charges, and when she continued to rebuff him, she encountered hostility from the Fox News publicity department. In the February meeting, she said, Mr. Ailes talked about how she would look in a bikini, and accused her of ending a   relationship because she had been merely using the man. The episode brought her to tears, the lawsuit states. She said the sole interview arranged by the publicity department during that period was with a writer for a blog controlled by Fox, who asked about her breasts and if she was difficult to work with. In April 2015, the lawsuit states, Ms. Tantaros met with Bill Shine, then a senior news executive and close aide to Mr. Ailes. She said that she told him about the meetings with Mr. Ailes and asked if he had told the head of publicity for Fox News, Irena Briganti, to go after her. The lawsuit claims that Mr. Shine โ€told Tantaros that Briganti is like a rabid dog on a chain that we canโ€t control. Sometimes that dog gets off the chain. โ€ Then, pointing to a picture of Mr. Ailes on a magazine cover, the lawsuit charges, Mr. Shine told her that โ€this powerful man has faith in Irena Brigantiโ€ and that Ms. Tantaros โ€needs to let this one go. โ€ Mr. Shine, through a spokeswoman, has said that Ms. Tantaros never approached him about Mr. Ailes harassing her. Mr. Shine was named   of Fox News after Mr. Ailes departed.",0

30,Chuck Todd to BuzzFeed EIC: โ€You Just Published Fake Newsโ€ - Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,"During a discussion of BuzzFeedโ€s story on a dossier regarding Russia and   Donald Trump on Wednesdayโ€s broadcast of MSNBCโ€s โ€MTP Daily,โ€ host Chuck Todd told BuzzFeed    Ben Smith โ€you just published fake news. โ€  Todd said BuzzFeedโ€s decision to publish the dossier was an instance where they โ€would not have made the same decision in the   era. โ€ Smith stated that it was more โ€the   era. โ€ And that there was a time โ€where we could act as gatekeepers. Where we could say, you know what, crazy people are claiming that Barack Obamaโ€s birth certificate is forged, but weโ€re not going to write about that, thatโ€s crazy. โ€ He continued that this era doesnโ€t exist, and that while they had reporters trying to confirm or deny specific details, the dossier was โ€in play,โ€ and โ€having consequences for the way our elected leaders are acting. The  โ€”   you do have to ask the question of, why should I suppress that? There are then good reasons, right? Once though, it emerges, as it did last night in the public conversation that there is this secret document floating around, full of dark allegations that we will not repeat to you. That I feel like in this era, you really have to share [with] your readers what that is in an appropriate context. And our original report, I mean, if you read what we wrote, it stressed that there were real solid reasons to distrust this. It noted two specific errors. โ€ Todd then asked if BuzzFeed had a responsibility to not spread false information. Smith responded that, like with the Obama birth certificate issue, itโ€s a โ€difficult balance that everybody in our business navigates every day. โ€ Todd then asked if BuzzFeed would publish a false birth certificate. Smith answered, โ€We certainly quoted the   of the United States making false claims about it, and years ago we debated whether we should quote regular citizens in Iowa saying, I donโ€t believe his birth certificate. And I remember us thinking at first, we probably shouldnโ€t. That we we shouldnโ€t pass that on and then saying, you know what, this has become a force that is impacting the conversation. โ€ Todd countered, โ€I know this was not your intent. Iโ€ve known you a long time, but you just published fake news. โ€ Smith countered that people throw the term โ€fake newsโ€ around to diminish things they donโ€t like, and that โ€this was a real story about a real document that was really being passed around between the very top officials of this country. And then the question you say is, okay, itโ€s okay for you  โ€”   to Chuck Todd see this document. Itโ€s okay for me to see it. Okay for Senator John McCain ( ). Okay for the CIA. Whatโ€s  โ€”   why is it not okay for your audience?โ€ Todd then countered that BuzzFeed could have published a redacted version of the document. Smith answered that there was fair disagreement, but didnโ€t think you could defend acknowledging the dossierโ€s existence but then not say what was in it and that this was saying it was okay to summarize false claims. Smith further stated that if there wasnโ€t a โ€public conversationโ€ about the dossier, they would have just continued to report the story out.

31,Israel is Becoming Pivotal to Chinaโ€s Mid-Eastern Calculus http://journal-neo.org/2016/11/07/israel-is-becoming-pivotal-to-china-s-mid-eastern-calculus/,nan,"Country: Israel While China is silently playing an important role in the mitigation of the conflict in the Middle East, which is an important market for the Chinese goods, continuously deteriorating security situation, marred by the presence of numerous jihadi groups in the region, the necessity for China to have a strong anchor in the region has become all the more evident today than it was few years ago. The so-called โ€Arab springโ€ has brought many changes in its wake. However, war being one of the most important outcomes of this โ€springโ€, certain changes in the erstwhile foreign policy orientation of many countries, big and small alike, was expected. To this particular outcome owes the growth of China-Israel relations that continue to develop stronger and deeper every year. Facts speak for themselves: Chinaโ€s total capital investment in Israeli high-tech deals involving Chinese businesses is expected to reach around $500 million by the end of 2016, compared to $467 million in 2014 and $118 million in 2012. And as Times of Israel reported recently, Chinese acquisitions in Israel have dramatically increased in the last few years. In March 2015, Chinaโ€s Bright Food acquired Tnuva , one of Israelโ€s largest dairy companies for approximately $2.1 billion. Similarly, in July 2016, a Chinese consortium that included private equity firm Yunfeng Capital โ€” founded by Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma โ€“ acquired Israeli social games company Playtika from Caesars Interactive Entertainment online games unit for $4.4 billion in cash. In August 2016, ChemChina completed its takeover of Adama โ€” considered one of the worldโ€s leading crop protection companies โ€” for approximately $1.4 billion. The high level of growth isโ€”and it is not a coincidenceโ€”running parallel to the intensification and geographical spread of the conflict in the Mid-East region, particularly in and around the Suez canal region. While Syria and Iraq are direct victims of terrorism, many important countries such as Egypt (read: Egyptโ€s Sisi is building ties with Syria because of the fears of being the next target of jihadist militias) are only inches away from breaking down into shatters, pushing China to find an alternative route and construct an alternative geography of trade to steer its own business in the region. Israel, as such, happens to be the best country in the region. Not only is it politically and militarily stable, but its geographical location also makes it an apt candidate to qualify for partnership in Chinaโ€s โ€Silk Roadโ€ on its southern corridor, which is Chinaโ€s route to Europe. Before the emergence of โ€jihadiโ€ groups in the Middle East, China depended on the Suez Canal to reach its largest export destination: Europe. With its trade volume standing roughly at โฌ521 billion in 2015, and the volume of their bi-lateral trade crossing well over โฌ1 billion a day , Europe undoubtedly remains one of the most important markets for the Chinese business, and with it remains the Mid-East the only geographical entity to facilitate this trade. However, the presence of ISIS, Al Qaeda and other Islamic extremist groups in the Sinai are threatening Chinaโ€s maritime trade. With over 95% of global trade being seaborne and China now as the worldโ€s largest trading state, this is a serious challenge for Beijingโ€s continued economic development. The crisis in the Middle East is, therefore, directly threatening Chinaโ€s economic interest. And, while China has already stepped in the crisis (read: Chinaโ€s Rear Adm Guan Youfei recently visited Syria to boost co-operation with the Syrian army), this is not the only way it is following to protect its vital interests. This is where Israel becomes important for China. The growing economic alliance between Israel and China is moving forward with a $2 billion, 300 kilometre freight rail link connecting Eilat, on the Red Sea, with Ashdod Port, on the Mediterranean. The project, nicknamed the โ€Red-Med,โ€ was greenlit by Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuโ€s cabinet, and construction, which is expected to take five years, will begin within the year. About the link, Netanyahu said, โ€Itโ€s the first time weโ€d be able to assist the countries in Europe and Asia to make sure they always have an open connection between Europe and Asia and between Asia and Europe.โ€ While Israel is clearly poised to play a pivotal role in providing an unhindered and a secure trade route for European and Asia countries, Chinaโ€s primary motivation is not to merely to build a network of allies in the Middle East. For China, the primary concern remains, apart from its trade with the Mid-Eastern countries, access to Europe and the African continent via the Middle East. However, both of these concerns cannot be effectively satisfied when the entire region remains under crisis. China, due to its fairly balanced approach to the crisis and the fact that it is perhaps the only global player that continues to enjoy equally good relations with such arch rivals as, for instance, Israel and Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran, is an important country for the regional countries to look up to as a conflict mediator. This assumption about China playing this role owes its existence to the geography of trade China is eyeing to build through the Mid-East. As an alternative to shipping through the crowded Suez Canal, China sees value in sending goods into the Persian Gulf, and shipping them overland to the Mediterranean via several lines that could cross through Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar or even southern Iraq before finally continuing through Jordan and Israel. Will China eventually built this geography or not is a moot question. However, it is quite obvious that regional countries are open to it and know the potential benefits it can yield. Speaking at to the inaugural SIGNAL conference on Israelโ€s China policy at the IDC in Herzliya in the last week of September, Capt. Yigal Maor, director general of the Israelโ€s Transportation Ministryโ€s Administration of Shipping and Ports, said that If China invests in building those paths, which he dubbed IGEC โ€“ the Israel Gulf Economic Corridor โ€“ it could push Gulf countries into more formal ties with Israel. โ€Maybe with the help of China there will be peace in that area,โ€ he said. Whereas such prospects signal Israelโ€s own elevation from the position of a US โ€protectedโ€ state to an important power, integrating the region, as also continents, the potential entry of the โ€dragonโ€ in the region, connecting various countries into a whole, is likely to yield important results for the whole region. While we may have to wait a little to see what impact it leaves exactly, it is quite obvious that China is poised to become an important player in the Mideast security scene, and is already asserting its role economically, diplomatically and, to some extent, militarily.

32,"Having Won, Boris Johnson and โ€Brexitโ€ Leaders Fumble - The New York Times",Steven Erlanger,"LONDON  โ€”   With their giddy celebrations of โ€independence dayโ€ having given way to political and economic turmoil, one thing has become especially clear about the former London mayor Boris Johnson and other leaders of the successful campaign to vote Britain out of the European Union: They had no plan for what comes next. In the days since Britain voted to leave the bloc, the movementโ€s leaders have often appeared as if they had not expected to win and were not prepared to cope with the consequences. Faced with the scope of the decision, they have been busy walking back promises they made during the campaign and scaling back expectations. They have failed to show a united front or to answer basic questions. Their faltering performance has added to the sense of political chaos in Britain and, arguably, to the turmoil in the financial markets. And it has undercut their credibility and authority as Mr. Johnson prepares his bid to become prime minister and lead Britain into a new relationship with the Continent. The stakes are high for Mr. Johnson in particular, as he tries to build an impression as a capable leader amid the chaos that followed the vote in favor of a British exit, or โ€Brexit. โ€ But the mixed signals coming from him and other proponents of leaving the European Union have left their intentions unclear on such basic issues as when and how they will seek to negotiate a withdrawal, and what kind of new arrangement they want. To the degree that they have signaled a direction, it has often been substantially different from what they promised during the campaign. On issues from immigration to spending on the National Health Service, the โ€Leaveโ€ coalition has retreated from its more populist and apparently exaggerated claims. Many of those assertions had been promoted by the   U. K. Independence Party, or UKIP, led by Nigel Farage, and benefited the broader Leave campaign, whose most prominent figures included two senior Conservatives, Mr. Johnson and Michael Gove, the justice minister. In changing their tune, the leaders of the   Union campaign risk undermining whatever trust they had earned from the millions who voted to leave the bloc in the expectation that immigration would be cut sharply and that money now going to the European Union  โ€”   which the Leave campaign said was 350 million pounds, or $465 million, a week  โ€”   would be available to help finance the National Health Service. For example, one Leave advocate, Iain Duncan Smith, a former Conservative Party leader and cabinet secretary, walked away from the campaign pledge to reallocate the ยฃ350 million a week to the health service. Instead, he said, โ€the lionโ€s shareโ€ of anything left from that amount after replacing subsidies from the bloc to British farmers could be available for health services. On immigration, too, there was immediate backtracking from Mr. Johnson and Daniel Hannan, a member of the European Parliament from the Conservative Party, who told the BBC, โ€Frankly, if people watching think that they have voted and there is now going to be zero immigration from the E. U. they are going to be disappointed. โ€ Analysts say the change in tone may be necessary to begin reeling in unrealistic expectations about the changes the referendum could produce, but it also holds considerable political peril for Mr. Johnson and other Conservative Party leaders of the Leave campaign, especially with populist sentiment spreading and   groups like the U. K. Independence Party eager to build support. โ€There is a clear tension between what the voter wanted and what senior euroskeptic leaders want to produce,โ€ said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics and international relations at the University of Kent. โ€If they donโ€t deliver radical reforms on immigration, it would be the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the populist UKIP fire that has been burning since 2010. โ€ In his regular column in The Daily Telegraph on Monday, Mr. Johnson tried to strike a prime ministerial tone of unity in the wake of the divisive referendum, but he emphasized continuity over change and tried to argue that immigration, clearly the primary motivation for many voters in taking a position against Europe, was somehow not a major issue. โ€It is said that those who voted Leave were mainly driven by anxieties about immigration,โ€ Mr. Johnson wrote. โ€I do not believe that is so. โ€ Suggesting that he wants to keep some kind of open flow of people across the border with Europe, Mr. Johnson wrote, โ€British people will still be able to go and work in the E. U. to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down. โ€ Not only that, he asserted, โ€There will continue to be free trade, and access to the single market. โ€ What he described was a relationship with the European Union like that of Norway, which would allow freedom of movement and labor and would pay money to Brussels in return for access to the single market, but without having a voice in  . But Mr. Johnson rejected the Norway model during the campaign, and even if negotiations proved to lead to a slightly enhanced Norway, with some symbolic measures to restrict immigration of European Union citizens to Britain, the result would be a betrayal of those who voted Leave. And right now, Norway pays Brussels roughly per capita what Britain currently does as a full member. โ€The difficulty for Boris and Gove is that Brexit feels like a column gone wrong, an academic exercise suddenly turned into reality,โ€ Paul Waugh wrote in his blog for The Huffington Post, alluding to the shared backgrounds in journalism of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Gove. โ€And reality, particularly where the E. U. is concerned, is a messy, complex thing. โ€ Mr. Johnson is clearly looking to unite the divided Conservative Party behind his own, flamboyant self and to burnish his   economic credentials. But playing down immigration, Mr. Goodwin said, could create more political trouble. โ€I worry for senior euroskeptic leaders, because there is a misunderstanding of the vote, and that will feed voter dissatisfaction,โ€ he said, driving many of the voters who chose a British exit to turn away from both mainstream parties and move to the populist right. The referendum was unusual, because it pitted a government on one side, โ€Remain,โ€ against a loose coalition on the other, made up of Conservatives, some Labour legislators and U. K. Independence Party supporters. The Leave side never had to hammer out an agreement on how to proceed if it won, said Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics. โ€There was no coherence, because it wasnโ€t a political party fighting for government, but an odd coalition fighting against something, but with no consistent view of what it was fighting for,โ€ he said. Even on the economy, the Leave side was made of   economists who believe in no tariffs at all, those who believe in trade deals and protectionists who want to shield the declining working class against globalization, Professor Travers said. โ€And now the government will have to be reformed as if it were representing the Leave side and yet represent both, a   government that must reflect the schism in itself,โ€ he said. In the aftermath of the Leave campaignโ€s victory, the political editor for Sky News, Faisal Islam, asked a Conservative member of Parliament who supported leaving the bloc to see his campโ€s plan. The legislator replied, according to Mr. Islam: โ€There is no plan. The Leave campaign donโ€t have a   plan. โ€ Then the legislator added, โ€Number 10 should have had a plan,โ€ referring to the prime ministerโ€s office.",0
33,"Texas Oil Fields Rebound From Price Lull, but Jobs Are Left Behind - The New York Times",Clifford Krauss,"MIDLAND, Tex.  โ€”   In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for   workers, Eustasio Velazquezโ€s career has been upended by technology. For 10 years, he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher. Then, powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection, and he lost his job. He found new work connecting pipes on rigs, but lost that job, too, when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper, more reliable automated tools. โ€I donโ€t see a future,โ€ Mr. Velazquez, 44, said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store. โ€Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot. โ€ Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the     jobs  โ€”   just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back. But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal. As in other industries, automation is creating a new demand for   workers  โ€”   sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center  โ€”   but their numbers donโ€t offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron. So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum, discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries, especially among those who are   with no more than a high school education. Roughly 163, 000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak, or about 30 percent of the total, while oil prices plummeted, at one point by as much as 70 percent. The job losses just in Texas, the most productive   state, totaled 98, 000. Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power. โ€People have left the industry, and they are not coming back,โ€ said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. โ€If itโ€s a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I donโ€t need someone to do that. I can get a computer to do that. โ€ Indeed, computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually. The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time  โ€”   onshore or miles out to sea  โ€”   and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong, all without leaving their desks. It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure, reducing the need for a technician to check. And despite all the lost workers, United States oil production is galloping upward, to nine million barrels a day from 8. 6 million in September. Nationwide, with a bit more than   as many rigs operating as in 2014, production is not even down 10 percent from record levels. Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over $60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about $35, well below the current price of about $53. Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries, along with deepwater oil exploration, over more than a decade. But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business. All the big companies, and many smaller ones, have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them to duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over, and to repair valves and other parts before they break down. The result is improved production and safety, but also a far smaller work force, and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most productive West Texas producers, has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it has been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015. The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16. Last year, the company added nearly 240 wells to its Permian Basin inventory without adding new employees. The faster operations, Pioneer executives say, are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering. Both have been made possible by the   computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well. The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches, for instance, has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen. A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells, yielding diesel and labor cost savings. โ€We want to transform our work force to the point where we need to hire fewer people,โ€ said Joey Hall, Pioneerโ€s executive vice president for Permian operations. Improved computing streamlines operations, he noted, and lets technicians optimally space their wells and more accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale veins to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground. โ€Weโ€re heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning, analyzing thousands of algorithms,โ€ Mr. Hall added, sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter. โ€Through repetitive operations, you learn the patterns, and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions. โ€ With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force, with demand growing for more data analysts, math scientists, communications specialists and robotic design engineers. In the last two years, ABB, the Swiss technology company, has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations. GE Oil and Gas opened a technology center in Oklahoma City in October to place scientists closer to the oil fields to research and apply new digital industrial technologies for exploration and production. Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect equipment and identify methane leaks on oil sites. Nabors, the oil services giant, has 100 employees developing software, 10 times the number it had only a few years ago. โ€With the adoption of all this   software and stuff, weโ€ve had to bring in a lot of new technicians,โ€ said Dennis A. Smith, a Nabors vice president. A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel, a    mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources. In less than two years, he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing, optimizing the amounts of fluids, sand and chemicals pumped into the wells. Now, connected by computers to technicians in the field, he is monitoring the production of 950 wells, instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse. โ€Iโ€m lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science,โ€ he said. But smaller companies and their workers are struggling to keep up. S. O. C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider, is forced to invest $100, 000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request. The added expenses are one reason the company has let go 15 of the 60 field workers employed three years ago. Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half. Some of the remaining S. O. C. employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems. โ€Itโ€s a struggle,โ€ said Rodrigo Urias, 59, an S. O. C. truck driver, who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures. Now he needs to reset computer screens, take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations. โ€A lot of the guys canโ€t operate these new technologies, tablets and instruments, and they keep whining,โ€ he added. โ€They want to know why we canโ€t do things like we used to. โ€ Manufacturing executives say they are trying to minimize the complexity for field workers, and sometimes design their equipment with the advice of video game makers. Thatโ€s a good thing for Michael Manga, 34, an employee of Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma company active here. A college dropout, he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to the oil patch. Now, playing video games like Call of Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off, giving him the   coordination to monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks that control the drilling rig. โ€We do such a good job now,โ€ he said, โ€weโ€re drilling ourselves out of a job. โ€",0
34,"Bayer Deal for Monsanto Follows Agribusiness Trend, Raising Worries for Farmers - The New York Times","Leslie Picker, Danny Hakim and Michael J. de la Merced","Don Halcomb, a    farmer in Adairville, Ky. is expecting his profit to vanish this year, largely because of the confluence of falling crop prices and rising costs for seeds and other materials. The price of an   bag of seed corn rose to $300 from $80 in the last decade, as the companies that produced them consolidated, he said. And with the recent decline in commodity prices, Mr. Halcomb said he expects to lose $100 an acre this year. โ€Weโ€re producing our crops at a loss now, just like the oil guys are pumping oil at a loss,โ€ Mr. Halcomb, who grows corn, soybeans, wheat and barley on his   family farm, said by telephone on Wednesday. โ€You canโ€t cut your costs fast enough. โ€ It is a common plight of farmers across the United States, with the global agriculture industry in a wrenching downturn. Because farmers have produced too much corn, wheat and soybeans, they have been forced to slash prices to sell their crops. They have also reduced spending on seeds, pesticides and fertilizer, which has eaten into sales at agribusiness giants, including Monsanto and DuPont. In response, these companies have sought   deals to cut costs and weather the industryโ€s storm. Four major agribusiness mergers have been announced in the last year. The latest is Bayer AGโ€s $56 billion takeover of Monsanto  โ€”   the largest acquisition of 2016  โ€”   announced on Wednesday. Every merger creates the possibility of higher costs for farmers. Mr. Halcomb buys seeds with traits licensed to Monsanto of St. Louis and seeds from DuPont, which has a deal pending to merge with Dow Chemical. His fertilizers are made of potassium compounds and phosphate produced by Agrium of Calgary, Alberta, which on Monday agreed to combine with the fertilizer producer Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan. He uses pesticides made by Syngenta of Switzerland, which agreed in February to a takeover by the China National Chemical Corporation. โ€Itโ€s just like any other industry that consolidates,โ€ Mr. Halcomb said. โ€They tell the regulators theyโ€re   and then they tell their customers they have to increase pricing after the dealโ€s done. โ€ The companies say they are merging to diversify and increase growth and research capabilities, but these deals, given their size and scope, have already caught the attention of lawmakers and regulators in Washington. There is no guarantee that they will all receive regulatory approval, and some companies may have to sell assets to allay antitrust concerns. Dowโ€s merger with DuPont is under Justice Department review. The market seemed to anticipate hurdles for the Monsanto deal on Wednesday. Shares of the company closed about 20 percent lower than the $128 per share cash offer from Bayer, which is based in Leverkusen, Germany. Shares of each company gained less than 1 percent after the deal was announced. Adding the assumption of about $10 billion of Monsanto debt, Bayerโ€s total $66 billion pact is the largest   deal, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters, ahead of InBevโ€s $60. 4 billion offer for another St.   company,   in June 2008. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, scheduled a hearing next week to discuss the possible effect of these   mergers on farming. Iowa produced more corn last year than any other state, according to the National Corn Growers Association. โ€It seems to be catching fire and happening so fast with so many,โ€ Senator Grassley said in a phone interview. โ€When you have less competition, prices go up. โ€ European competition regulators also said publicly, before a   deal was even signed, that they would look at how it could affect prices and the availability of seed products, as well as research. Liam Condon, who leads Bayerโ€s   division, said in an interview that the company did an โ€extensive analysisโ€ with regard to antitrust before approaching Monsanto in May. Mr. Condon said that he does not believe there is much overlap between their portfolios, because Bayerโ€s focus is largely on crop protection, while Monsantoโ€s is on seeds and traits. He said the companies assume they may need to sell off some assets to appease regulators. Monsanto, which is famous for its production of genetically modified seeds, rejected several offers from Bayer as too low. Wednesdayโ€s deal represented a 44 percent premium to Monsantoโ€s stock price on May 9, the day before Bayerโ€s interest in a deal surfaced. To assuage Monsantoโ€s concerns, Bayer threw in a $2 billion breakup fee if the deal fell apart on antitrust grounds. The strategic goal of the deal, according to Bill Selesky, an analyst at Argus Research, is to create a    experience for farmers, making Bayer the worldโ€s largest supplier of seeds and farm chemicals. By improving the product for farmers, the combined company could ultimately raise prices, Mr. Selesky said in an interview. Senator Grassley said that he had spoken with a few farmers who believed the deals were necessary so large agribusinesses could continue to absorb the costs of researching and developing products and getting government approval for them. Bayer and Monsanto said they planned to cut about $1. 2 billion worth of costs as part of the deal, helping to improve efficiency. But Jim Benham of Versailles, Ind. the president of the Indiana Farmers Union, was not so optimistic. He blamed the rising costs of inputs  โ€”   seeds, fertilizer and the like  โ€”   for eating away at farmersโ€ profit margins, and warned that consolidation will make it worse. Costs have already risen by double digits over the last four to five years, and the proposed   merger could accelerate that. โ€The merger is going to hurt the farmer,โ€ said Mr. Benham, who grows corn, soybeans and sometimes wheat on his   farm. โ€The more consolidation we have on our inputs, the worse it gets. โ€ Mr. Condon of Bayer said that the company would not raise prices without providing more value to farmers. โ€This is a highly competitive industry, and just increasing prices without having any additional advantage or benefit for growers wonโ€t go anywhere,โ€ he said. โ€Itโ€s up to us to show what weโ€re offering will help farmers improve their return on investment. โ€ Some farmers said the consolidation could even enable prices to fall. Christine Hamilton manages a farm of more than 12, 000 acres in Kimball, S. D. growing crops like corn and operating a ranch. She said that if the deal can pass the antitrust screening, then maybe it could actually help farmers. โ€I understand how companies need to get bigger in order to be competitive,โ€ she said. โ€As we are in a low part of the cycle, anything that might have a chance of reducing our input prices would be great. โ€",0
35,Russia Moves to Ban Jehovahโ€s Witnesses as โ€Extremistโ€ - The New York Times,Andrew Higgins,"VOROKHOBINO, Russia  โ€”   A dedicated pacifist who has never even held a gun, Andrei Sivak discovered that his government considered him a dangerous extremist when he tried to change some money and the teller โ€suddenly looked up at me with a face full of fear. โ€ His name had popped up on the exchange bureauโ€s computer system, along with those of members of Al Qaeda, the Islamic State and other militant groups responsible for shocking acts of violence. The only group the    father of three has ever belonged to, however, is Jehovahโ€s Witnesses, a Christian denomination committed to the belief that the Bible must be taken literally, particularly its injunction โ€Thou shalt not kill. โ€ Yet, in a throwback to the days of the Soviet Union, when Jehovahโ€s Witnesses were hounded as spies and malcontents by the K. G. B. the denomination is at the center of an escalating campaign by the authorities to curtail religious groups that compete with the Russian Orthodox Church and that challenge President Vladimir V. Putinโ€s efforts to rally the country behind traditional and often militaristic patriotic values. The Justice Ministry, in a preliminary adminstrative strike last month, put the headquarters of Jehovahโ€s Witnesses in Russia, an office complex near St. Petersburg, on a list of the bodies banned โ€in connection with the carrying out of extremist activities. โ€ Whether it stays there will depend on Russiaโ€s Supreme Court, which is scheduled to meet on Wednesday to hear a request from the Justice Ministry to outlaw the religious organization and stop its more than 170, 000 Russian members from spreading โ€extremistโ€ texts. Extremism, as defined by a law passed in 2002 but amended and expanded several times since, has become a catchall charge that can be deployed against just about anybody, as it has been against some of those involved in recent   protests in Moscow and scores of other cities. Several students who took part in demonstrations in the Siberian city of Tomsk are now being investigated by a special   unit, while Leonid Volkov, the senior aide to the jailed protest leader Aleksei A. Navalny, said he himself was detained last week under the extremism law. In the case of Jehovahโ€s Witnesses, the putative extremism seems to derive mostly from the groupโ€s absolute opposition to violence, a stand that infuriated Soviet and now Russian authorities whose legitimacy rests in large part on the celebration of martial triumphs, most notably over Nazi Germany in World War II but also over rebels in Syria. Jehovahโ€s Witnesses, members of a denomination founded in the United States in the 19th century and active in Russia for more than 100 years, refuse military service, do not vote and view God as the only true leader. They shun the patriotic festivals promoted with gusto by the Kremlin, like the annual celebration of victory in 1945 and recent events to celebrate the annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Mr. Sivak, who says he lost his job as a physical education teacher because of his role as a Jehovahโ€s Witnesses elder, said he voted for Mr. Putin in 2000, three years before joining the denomination. He added that while he had not voted since, nor had he supported   activities of the sort that usually attract the attention of Russiaโ€s   version of the K. G. B. the Federal Security Service, or F. S. B. โ€I have absolutely no interest in politics,โ€ he said during a recent Jehovahโ€s Witnesses Friday service in a wooden country house in Vorokhobino, a   village north of Moscow. Around 100 worshipers crammed into a long, chilly room under fluorescent lights to listen to readings from the Bible, sing and watch a video advising them to dress for worship as they would for a meeting with the president. โ€From the Russian stateโ€s perspective, Jehovahโ€s Witnesses are completely separate,โ€ said Geraldine Fagan, the author of โ€Believing in Russia  โ€”   Religious Policy After Communism. โ€ She added, โ€They donโ€t get involved in politics, but this is itself seen as a suspicious political deviation. โ€ โ€The idea of independent and public religious activity that is completely outside the control of  โ€”   and also indifferent to  โ€”   the state sets all sorts of alarm bells ringing in the Orthodox Church and the security services,โ€ she said. That the worldwide headquarters of Jehovahโ€s Witnesses is in the United States and that its publications are mostly prepared there, Ms. Fagan added, โ€all adds up to a big conspiracy theoryโ€ for the increasingly assertive F. S. B. For Mr. Sivak, it has added up to a long legal nightmare. His troubles began, he said, when undercover security officers posed as worshipers and secretly filmed a service where he was helping to officiate in 2010. Accused of โ€inciting hatred and disparaging the human dignity of citizens,โ€ he was put on trial for extremism along with a second elder, Vyacheslav Stepanov, 40. The prosecutorโ€s case, heard by a municipal court in Sergiyev Posad, a center of the Russian Orthodox Church, produced no evidence of extremism and focused instead on the insufficient patriotism of Jehovahโ€s Witnesses. โ€Their disregard for the state,โ€ a report prepared for the prosecution said, โ€erodes any sense of civic affiliation and promotes the destruction of national and state security. โ€ In a ruling last year, the court found the two men not guilty, and their ordeal seemed over  โ€”   until Mr. Sivak tried to change money and was told that he had been placed on a list of โ€terrorists and extremists. โ€ He and Mr. Stepanov now face new charges of extremism and are to appear before a regional court this month. โ€There is a big wave of repression breaking,โ€ Mr. Stepanov said. In response to written questions, the Justice Ministry in Moscow said a yearlong review of documents at the Jehovahโ€s Witnesses โ€administrative centerโ€ near St. Petersburg had uncovered violations of a Russian law banning extremism. As a result, it added, the center should be โ€liquidated,โ€ along with nearly 400 locally registered branches of the group and other structures. For the denominationโ€s leaders in Russia, the sharp escalation in a long campaign of harassment, previously driven mostly by local officials, drew horrifying flashbacks to the Soviet era. Vasily Kalin, the chairman of Jehovahโ€s Witnessesโ€ Russian arm, recalled that his whole family had been deported to Siberia when he was a child. โ€It is sad and reprehensible that my children and grandchildren should be facing a similar fate,โ€ he said. โ€Never did I expect that we would again face the threat of religious persecution in modern Russia. โ€ In Russia, as in many countries, the    proselytizing of Jehovahโ€s Witnesses often causes irritation, and their theological idiosyncrasies disturb many mainstream Christians. The group has also been widely criticized for saying that the Bible prohibits blood transfusions. But it has never promoted violent or even peaceful political resistance. โ€I cannot imagine that anyone really thinks they are a threat,โ€ said Alexander Verkhovsky, director of the SOVA Center for Information and Analysis, which monitors extremism in Russia. โ€But they are seen as a good target. They are pacifists, so they cannot be radicalized, no matter what you do to them. They can be used to send a message. โ€ That message, it would seem, is that everyone needs to get with the Putin program  โ€”   or risk being branded as an extremist for displaying indifference, never mind hostility, to the Kremlinโ€s drive to make Russia a great power again. โ€A big reason they are being targeted is simply that they are an easy target,โ€ Ms. Fagan said. โ€They donโ€t vote, so nobody is going to lose votes by attacking them. โ€ Attacking Jehovahโ€s Witnesses also sends a signal that even the mildest deviation from the norm, if proclaimed publicly and insistently, can be punished under the   law, which was passed after Russiaโ€s second war in Chechnya and the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States. Billed as a move by Russia to join a worldwide struggle against terrorism, the law prohibited โ€incitement of racial, national or religious strife, and social hatred associated with violence or calls for violence. โ€ But the reference to violence was later deleted, opening the way for the authorities to classify as extremist any group claiming to offer a unique, true path to religious or political salvation. Even the Russian Orthodox Church has sometimes fallen afoul of the law: The slogan โ€Orthodoxy or Death!โ€  โ€”   a rallying cry embraced by some   believers  โ€”   has been banned as an illegal extremist text. To help protect the Orthodox Church and other established religions, Parliament passed a law in 2015 to exempt the Bible and the Quran, as well as Jewish and Buddhist scripture, from charges of extremism based on their claims to offer the only true faith. The main impetus for the current crackdown, however, appears to come from the security services, not the Orthodox Church. Roman Lunkin, director of the Institute of Religion and Law, a Moscow research group, described it as โ€part of a broad policy of suppressing all nongovernmental organizationsโ€ that has gained particular force because of the highly centralized structure of Jehovahโ€s Witnesses under a worldwide leadership based in the United States. โ€They are controlled from outside Russia, and this is very suspicious for our secret services,โ€ he said. โ€They donโ€t like having an organization that they do not and cannot control. โ€ Artyom Grigoryan, a former Jehovahโ€s Witness who used to work at the groupโ€s Russian headquarters but who now follows the Orthodox Church, said the organization had โ€many positive elements,โ€ like its ban on excessive drinking, smoking and other unhealthy habits. All the same, he said it deserved to be treated with suspicion. โ€Look at it from the view of the state,โ€ he said. โ€Here is an organization that is run from America, that gets financing from abroad, and whose members donโ€t serve in the army and donโ€t vote. โ€ Estranged from his parents, who are still members and view his departure as sinful, he said Jehovahโ€s Witnesses broke up families and โ€in the logic of the state, it presents a threat. โ€ He added, โ€I am not saying this is real or not, but it needs to be checked by objective experts. โ€ Mr. Sivak, now preparing for yet another trial, said that he had always tried to follow the law and that he respected the state, but could not put its interests above the commands of his faith. โ€They say I am a terrorist,โ€ he said, โ€but all I ever wanted to do was to get people to pay attention to the Bible. โ€",0

Donald Trump is not the president yet, and Barack Obama could still do an extraordinary amount of damage during his last two months in the White House. Prior to the election, I described the period of time ending on January 20th as โ€the danger zoneโ€, and my outlook has not changed just because Donald Trump was victorious on election night. As you will see, the next two months are an absolutely critical time, and if we can get through January 20th without something major happening perhaps we can breathe a little bit easier (at least for a while). On the other hand, the events of the next two months could easily plunge this country into a period of unprecedented chaos. A lot of people are feeling really good about things right now because of Trumpโ€s victory, but now is definitely not a time to relax and let down our guard. 
And the truth is that Donald Trump has not even won the presidency yet. As I detailed shortly before election night , the next president will not be determined until December 19th when the Electoral College meets. 
On Monday, December 19th the members of the Electoral College will gather in all 50 state capitals to cast their votes for president. It is then, and only then, that the next president of the United States will be elected. 
Throughout our history, electors have followed the will of the people more than 99 perfect of the time, but there have been โ€faithless electorsโ€ before, and if Democrats can get enough of them to switch sides in December it is still possible (though not probable) that Hillary Clinton could win the election. 
One petition that is asking electors to switch their votes has already been signed by more than 4 million people. The petition claims that Donald Trump is โ€unfit to serveโ€ as president, and that since Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a wide margin she should be elected president instead. The following comes from a USA Today article entitled โ€ Could the Electoral College elect Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump? โ€โ€ฆ 
A Change.org petition, now signed by more than 4.3 million people, encourages members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for Hillary Clinton when the college meets on Dec. 19. The petition argues that Donald Trump is โ€unfit to serveโ€ and that โ€Secretary Clinton WON THE POPULAR VOTE and should be President.โ€ 
โ€If they all vote the way their states voted, Donald Trump will win,โ€ the petition states. โ€However, they can vote for Hillary Clinton if they choose. Even in states where that is not allowed, their vote would still be counted, they would simply pay a small fine โ€“ which we can be sure Clinton supporters will be glad to pay! We are calling on the Electors to ignore their statesโ€ votes and cast their ballots for Secretary Clinton.โ€ 
Personally, I donโ€t believe that this is going to happen. They may be able to flip a few electors, but the gap in electoral votes is almost certainly too wide for the Democrats to overcome. 
However, that is not the only concern we are facing. Ever since his victory on November 8th, there have been a multitude of violent threats against Donald Trump and his family. And without a doubt, there are a lot of very powerful people that would be very interested in finding a way to keep Donald Trump from getting to Inauguration Day. So let us pray for his safety and for the safety of his family. 
If Donald Trump were to be incapacitated after he wins the Electoral College vote on December 19th, Mike Pence would take his place. 
But if something were to happen to him before December 19th, his electors would be free to vote for another candidate โ€“ including Hillary Clinton. 
If everything goes smoothly and Donald Trump successfully makes it to Inauguration Day, he could be facing one of the biggest political protests in United States history. 
In an article for The Most Important News , I showed that the far left is calling for thousands upon thousands of protesters to descend upon Washington D.C. on January 20th in order to disrupt the Inauguration festivities as much as possible. 
This giant protest is being organized by the usual suspects, and they have already put up Facebook pages , websites , and the hashtag โ€#DisruptJ20โ€ณ is being widely used all over social media. 
Traditionally Inauguration Day is a day of joy and celebration, but the far left seems intent on transforming it into a massive riot. 
Let us hope that they are not successful. 
Another reason why we will be in โ€the danger zoneโ€ over the next two months is because of what Barack Obama may choose to do at the United Nations. 
Now that it looks like Donald Trump is going to be our next president, the international pressure on Barack Obama to do something at the United Nations regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before the end of his term has become even more intense. 
And this is something that Trump and his advisers are actively concerned about. In fact, I came across an article earlier today that discussed the fact that the Trump team is warning Obama โ€against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in officeโ€ โ€ฆ 
Saying that pushing agendas โ€contrary to the president-electโ€s positionโ€ would not be in the โ€spirit of the transitionโ€, Trump national security advisor for Donald Trump last week warned the Obama administration against making moves on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in his last months in office. 
โ€On big, transformative issues where President Obama and President-elect Trump are not in alignment, I donโ€t think itโ€s in keeping with the spirit of the transitionโ€ฆto try to push through agenda items that are contrary to the president-electโ€s positions,โ€ the advisor told Politico . 
Specifically, the concern is that Obama may decide to support a UN Security Council resolution that would officially recognize a Palestinian state, set the parameters for a โ€two state solutionโ€, and establish East Jerusalem as the capital for the new Palestinian state. 
Just a few weeks ago, an article in the Wall Street Journal entitled โ€ Obamaโ€s Israel Surprise? โ€ reported that this is one of the options that the Obama administration is strongly considering right now. A UN Security Council resolution would be legally binding on both Israel and the Palestinians, and it would be something that President Trump would not be able to undo. 
The rest of the UN Security Council is eager to support such a resolution, and so the decision about whether this resolution is going to happen or not sits in the hands of Barack Obama, and at this moment we do not know what he is going to do. The following comes from an article by Leo Hohmann โ€ฆ 
The Wall Street Journal reported one week before Tuesdayโ€s election that Obama had requested his aides provide him with a list of options to deal with the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
Israeli diplomats, according to the WSJ story, are preparing for the possibility that a lame-duck President Obama โ€may try to force a diplomatic resolution for Israel and the Palestinians at the United Nations.โ€ 
The president is presumably now reviewing those options, which number about half a dozen. 
He may be preparing to recognize a Palestinian state at the U.N. before he leaves office , WSJ reported. 
If Barack Obama decides to divide the land of Israel at the United Nations, it will be the worst decision of his entire presidency. I have warned repeatedly that all hell will break loose in America if it happens, and it will also mean that many of the events that I warn about in my latest book are much closer than many had been anticipating. 
But if we can get to January 20th and the land of Israel has not been divided yet, we may be able to rest easy for at least a little while, because Trump has already said that he would not support a UN Security Council resolution that forces a solution on the Israelis and Palestinians. 
When politicians are going to do something that they know people wonโ€t like, they tend to try to sneak it through around the holidays when a lot of people arenโ€t paying attention. For example, yesterday I discussed how the legislation that created the Federal Reserve was rushed through Congress right before Christmas in 1913 . 
So keep an eye on the period around Thanksgiving and the period around Christmas. If Barack Obama is going to stab Israel in the back, it may happen during one of those times. 
My hope is that we can get through January 20th without anything going seriously wrong. If that happens, I know that I will be very thankful. 
And as I detailed in a previous article , Donald Trump will be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day in office on January 21st, and that will happen in year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. 
Could that be a sign of better things ahead as many believe? 
Or will the next two months set off a chain of events that will be absolutely disastrous for this nation? 
I believe that this is an absolutely critical moment in our history, and let us hope that our leaders make the right decisions.

I am a political atheist, just to set the record straight. Although I visit this site fairly often, it is showing signs of paranoia and provoking fear. When George W. as elected, there were many protesters, they were just hidden away in โ€free speechโ€ zones. Of course there are many unhappy people, as there were in 2000, and every election. Trumps votes were less than 19% of the 325 million people in the country. Will Trump bring jobs. No, not unless they are govโ€t employees, or funded by taxes. There is only one way jobs are created, and that is when there is demand for products and services. A lot of people with their low paying jobs can hardly afford the basic necessities, let alone keep playing the consumerism game. I cannot see Obama doing anything that requires legislation, as he is lame duck status now. Perhaps this site needs to focus on the swamp getting filled with more careerists, especially lobbyists I have been an expat for over 6 years, it is a lovely peaceful warm day here.

Yes, there is still a possibility that Hillary Clinton could still get in the Oval Office. But a Trump presidency is pretty much a done deal (knock on wood).

Letโ€s hope that Trumpโ€s presidency will be a successful one, and that it heals the many divisions and other issues that plague our country.

There are many forms of freedom. You criticize the left but you just donโ€t understand it. Hereโ€s how the left thinks: 
โ€An old English judge once said: โ€Necessitous men are not free men.โ€ Liberty requires opportunity to make a living โ€“ a living decent according to the standard of the time, a living which gives man not only enough to live by, but something to live for. 
โ€For too many of us the political equality we once had won was meaningless in the face of economic inequality. A small group had concentrated into their own hands an almost complete control over other peopleโ€s property, other peopleโ€s money, other peopleโ€s labor โ€“ other peopleโ€s lives. For too many of us life was no longer free; liberty no longer real; men could no longer follow the pursuit of happiness. 
Against economic tyranny such as this, the American citizen could appeal only to the organized power of government. โ€ 
You many not agree with this approach but ALL the evidence shows wealth inequality is at all time highs. Most of you right wingers claim we have too much socialism and communism in this country. The sad fact is we cannot be further way from communism and still have a currency with any shred of value. 
But do not fear. Every year the top 1% become richer and richer. Every year the middle class is driven deeper and deeper into poverty wages. Marx said laissez faire capitialism is always followed by communism because unfettered greed would result in a governmentโ€s currency collapse. Once the currency collapses people in bread lines will DEMAND more government not less.

The Podesta emails - After Hillary, John Podesta had been seriously warned about the Syrian chaos Posted by: nmb | Nov 18, 2016 1:59:59 PM | 1 
Although it is hilarious to see the Hillary supporters throwing a massive tantrum about 'fake news,' it does make it clear just how powerful having direct access to information is in negating money, mainstream media capture and control, and government propaganda. 
I don't know how much the new Trump presidency will change the US intelligence agency culture. But one has to assume they are apoplectic over their failure in Syria. Billions of dollars and years wasted all because people have direct access to information unfiltered out of Syria. 
It should have a completely unremarkable US regime change operation: 
* Send in the NGOs to agitate locals * Make promises of support for attacks on the government by the sole world superpower * Get selectively edited footage of your collaborators on the ground being attacked by the government(after they attacked the government) * Pump out mass amounts of propaganda based off that footage: ""Simple farmers rising up to overthrow a brutal regime!"" * Wield the tremendous economic power of the US to ensure the vast majority of smaller countries are on board with military action sanctioned by the UN * Flood the country with arms for anyone no matter how crazy to attack the government * Fake chemical attacks, US intelligence agency compromised UN reports and inspectors, etc. 
All of that derailed by nothing more than people having direct access to information uncensored out of Syria. 
I think it is safe to assume the US intelligence agencies are actively working on ways to make it illegal or impossible for anyone to publish, share, or consume 'unauthorized' information from countries that are targets of regime change. 
The easiest way would be to designate any source of information not actively working with or approved by the US intelligence agencies will be increasingly labeled as 'terror propaganda' and US social media and Internet providers will be required to censor or shutdown any such sources.

I was watching a travelogue program on PBS. The trip was to Cuba. The narrator traveled by train across the country. A train line that was originally built in the 1870s by Spain to divide the country for defensive and control purposes. The locomotives pulling the passenger cars were 1950s USA manufactured vintage and date to a time when our Federal Government had good economic relations with the Batista Regiem. 
When I think of the cruel and unusual economic punishment dished out to Cuba by our Federal Government all I can see is a bunch of financially poor peasants who bear the brunt of U.S. economic warfare. Just as in the Middle East and now Europe economic sanction wars hurt the farmer, the small business operator, the basic family unit, etc., while rich people get richer. Isn't it about time to back off on the economic war against Cuba and the rest of the Planet? Our collective cruelty seems to know no bounds?

Bernhard, I should think most of us reading and commenting here have pretty much accepted the result of the US presidential elections and are glad that Killer Klinton's ambitions have crashed and her future seems to be in a white house with steel bar columns and uniformed prison guards. 
The focus is now on President-elect Donald Trump's likely cabinet appointments, who are the most likely choices for critical positions like Defense Secretary and State Secretary, what the process is and how that is being carried out (or not carried out), and what that says about Trump's leadership and decision-making style, how he plans on being President and whether his choices are the right choices for his agenda (if it is genuine) of reforming the political culture on Capitol Hill, or ""draining the swamp"". 
If indeed Trump is intent on bringing changes to Capitol Hill, then there's a strong likelihood that the Soros-funded ""Color Revolution"" rioting around the US East and West Coasts will come to Washington and we'll be seeing a re-enactment of the Kiev Maidan events there. Posted by: Jen | Nov 18, 2016 3:01:27 PM | 5 
Does the Constitution of the United States require the president to have a specific number of executive departments? The answer is no. George Washington only had four departments in his administration as first President of the United States. 
Perhaps if Mr. Trump can't find suitable candidates for his cabinet when he ""drains the swamp"", he could assume the role as interim department head until such time as qualified non-militarists emerge from the private sector to serve in his administration.

No, you will not be seeing ""Maidan"". Middle America white (and not only) working class men are extremely well armed and are really angry still. So, if this rioting will come to Washington, who says that good ole' Ford Truck can not run over mountain bike of Tesla? Once the shooting starts (hopefully not) it will be a totally different game than Kiev ""Maidan"".

The Right firmly believes in Onward Xtian Soldiers for the Judeo-Xtian Axis, remember the $150,000,000,000 that 'Obama Paid As Hostage to Iran' was just a setup by the Right, that was Iran's sovereign national wealth held in overseas investments and illegally frozen by the Right as an *act of war*. 
When Obama agreed to end those illegal sanctions and let Iran retrieve their investments (which they may have done today, if you look at the huge market selloff), the Right again illegally crossed into Iran territory with their Navy patrol boats to create a false 'hostage' narrative. 
Those Navy boats know where they are by GPS withing 3.5 meters (10 feet), and Iran didn't beat them or waterboard them like AbuGraib or Gitmo, instead, they traded them for their *interest losses* on their illegally frozen foreign investments. 
With Huckabee as nee Ambassador to Israel, and neocon Pompeo as named CIA Director, and Jared Kushner getting top secret briefings to pass along to his Israeli blood-diamond partner Lev Leviev, you can bet the Xtian Soldiers will be pouring our blood and our treasure onto the radioactive sands of the Middle East, filling up the VA hospitals again for the Judeo-Xtian Axis of Greater Isreal.

We have one month before the electoral college votes. I suspect that this is the venue that the neolibcons will use to try to steal the election from Trump.

Even the ""blue"" states have very large and populous ""red"" areas--mostly beyond large urban centers which long ago became a cloaca of depravity. My point is, that this possible (how probable--that is totally another discussion) civil unrest, once ""red"" states America gets involved seriously, will not last too long for a number of purely tactical, operational and logistical reasons. This is if to discount the possibility of law enforcement actually enforcing the law and order which may, under certain conditions, turn very violent against those who will try to undermine constitutional process. Blue states can not win for mostly cultural reasons since, as I already stated, ""Red"" states' America is simply armed on several orders of magnitude better and is really angry. It is also tougher. Social and cultural composition of HRC's electorate speaks volumes--it is, in Steve Sailer's words (I think it was him), a ""coalition of the fringes"" and not very capable to start with.

WRT ""fake news"" and Soros paid rioters : Paul Horner โ€” the 38-year-old self-made titan of a fake news empire on Facebook โ€” is claiming responsibility for pushing Donald Trump to the White House, and says he has no plans to stop publishing fake news. 
In an interview with The Washington Post, Horner attributed his success to Trumpsโ€ particular base of supporters. He is the man behind such viral headlines as โ€The Amish in America Commit their Vote to Donald Trumpโ€ and โ€President Obama Signs Executive Order Banning the National Anthem at all Sporting Events Nationwideโ€ โ€” neither of which were true. 
โ€My sites were picked up by Trump supporters all the time. I think Trump is in the White House because of me. His followers donโ€t fact-check anything โ€” theyโ€ll post everything, believe anything. His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up.

The coming conflict is between globalism and nationalism. The basic problem is numbers. Rule by monopolistic global corporations, at best, supports 20% of the population in the short term. It enriches the ruling elite and their servants and improvises everyone else. In the long term, climate change or a nuclear war, brought on by the blind needs of greed, will end the world as we know it. Brexit and the Trump Presidency proved that globalism and democracy are incompatible. For globalism to proceed in the middle term, it will require a surveillance police state, total propaganda, reeducation camps and the shutdown of this bar.

It's great that there's some dialog between Trump and Putin. I think at least Western Syria will be cleansed of jihadis as a result. 
But Trump might be a little more hard nosed in the future. After the tensions are dialed down and having the score at basically Russia 1, US 0, he's not going to be so pliable. He sure as fuck isn't going to throw Israel under a bus. He's not going to roll over on all American commitments in the region. 
Trump's been getting a complete rundown on the big picture. It's no secret that until recently he couldn't have found Damascus on a map. Now he knows about the Shiite Crescent and how the arms can flow from Iran to Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon in volumes like never before and how upsetting that is for Israel. 
Now there's action towards taking Raqqa by the Kurds and who knows who else. The US and its posse will provide the air cover and logistics plus lots of special ops once it kicks in. I'm surprised the Kurds bit again after taking it up the arse from the US a couple of months ago They're not going all in right now as things are ongoing in Mosul and will be for a while. But you don't hear Assad and the Russians squawking much about it. It's like they both know that parts of Eastern Syria are bye-bye. 
Trump's good will towards Russia certainly doesn't extend to Iran. And no American will ever call Hezbollah anything bur a terrorist organization after the Marine barracks truck bombing in Beirut all those years ago. If Putin and Trump are going to come to a general understanding in the ME there's going to have to be some give and take. 
Putin's done quite a turnaround in taking Russia from a pariah state a couple of years ago to the player on the world sage that it is now. It's looking good for him to keep his man in power in Syria and to establish a permanent presence in the ME with Khmeimim and Tartus. Once Trump is fully up to speed on the totality of American interests in the region he is bound by his office not to walk away from them. There will have to be some serious deal-making.

Your timeline is a bit off. The coming of Putin was a direct result of NATO's 1999 aggression against Yugoslavia, while War of 08-08-08 was the start of Russia's return into big league. So, it is not a ""couple of years"". Results of War of 080808 actually stunned DC's neocon interventionist cabal.

Buzzfeed did some analysis on Social media generated fake news during the election. An awful lot of it was simply false. You can look at some of those headlines and judge for yourself. 
Ironically, Paul Horner (guy behind ""fake news empire"" I linked in prior post) said: He said he didnโ€t do it for ideological reasons. โ€I hate Trump,โ€ he told The Post. โ€I thought I was messing with the campaign, maybe I wasnโ€t messing them up as much as I wanted โ€” but I never thought heโ€d actually get elected.โ€

38,Democrat Gutierrez Blames Chicagoโ€s Gun Violence on NRA - Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,"Rep. Luis Gutierrez (  ) made the rounds on MSBNC and CNN, dismissing President Donald Trumpโ€s offer to help Chicago end gun violence, and blaming the NRA for the death and mayhem currently marring the Windy City. [Gutierrez was reacting to Trumpโ€s description of the โ€carnageโ€ in Chicago and his pledge to intervene federally if city leaders fail to stop the violence. On January 24 Trump tweeted:  If Chicago doesnโ€t fix the horrible โ€carnageโ€ going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016) I will send in the Feds!  โ€”   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017,  The following day, Gutierrez appeared on All In With Chris Hayes and said, โ€[President Trump] tweets about the โ€carnageโ€ and that heโ€s going to send the feds in. Did he send any extra money for police officers? We could use that, for training. โ€ He noted that Trump is increasing the number of Border Patrol agents on the southern border and said Chicago would like to have more federal agents โ€”  ATF and FBI โ€”  in the city as well. Then Gutierrez said: But  โ€ฆ    [President Trump is] with the NRA. The NRA that endorsed him, [that is]  โ€ฆ    so part of his relationship. You know that NRA did? It crippled the laws of the city of Chicago and the courts, so that we cannot keep guns off our streets. The next day Gutierrez appeared on CNN, where he was again asked about Trumpโ€s โ€carnageโ€ assessment and his pledge to send in the feds if Chicago city leaders fail to end the violence. Gutierrez said: Hereโ€s the hypocrisy of it all. The fact is, Donald Trump loves the NRA. And during his campaign he embraced them and they embraced him. The city of Chicago had some of the most stringent gun control laws, how were they eviscerated? Because the NRA funded lawsuits against our gun control measures. Gutierrez ignores the fact that Chicago had some its highest annual murder rates while all the cityโ€s gun controls were place. For example, the Chicago Police Department reports 921 murders during 1991, 940 during 1992. 850 during 2993, and 930 during 1994. These excessively high murder numbers all occurred while Chicagoโ€s ban on handgun ownership was in place. Viewed in this light, the 762 murders CNN reported for 2016 were a far cry from some of the murder numbers witnessed while Chicagoโ€s most โ€stringent gun controlsโ€ were in effect.

39,Avoiding Peanuts to Avoid an Allergy Is a Bad Strategy for Most - The New York Times,Aaron E. Carroll,"This article originally ran in April. We are resurfacing it in light of new guidelines from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that advise giving peanuts to children early and often as a strategy to forestall an allergy.  It has become an article of faith among many women I know to eliminate some foods during pregnancy, out of concern that their children could become allergic to them: shellfish, dairy and, most of all, peanuts. After their babies arrive, they continue to abstain from certain foods while   and they certainly keep their children from eating them. But research in the last few years has consistently shown that all this avoidance often does more harm than good. In many cases, we need to be doing the opposite. Mothers didnโ€t adopt this behavior out of nowhere. In 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines on reducing a childโ€s risk for developing allergies. They recommended that mothers โ€eliminate peanuts and tree nuts (e. g. almonds, walnuts, etc.) and consider eliminating eggs, cowโ€s milk, fish, and perhaps other foods from their diets while nursing. โ€ Further, they recommended that children at high risk for allergies be given no solid foods until six months of age, no dairy products until 1 year old, no eggs until age 2, and no peanuts, nuts or fish until age 3. A debate has been raging in the health care system for decades on this topic. I was part of a systematic review that examined the relationship between early solid food introduction and allergic disease in children. We found no good evidence to support the idea that being exposed to solid foods earlier led to persistent food allergies. To its credit, the A. A. P. changed its recommendations based on new research. In 2008, updated guidelines reported that maternal restrictions in pregnancy or   no longer seemed like advice that should be widely recommended. It also acknowledged that there didnโ€t seem much reason to delay the introduction of โ€allergyโ€ foods like peanuts after six months, around the age babies move from milk or formula to a wider range of food. Unfortunately, this did little to change peopleโ€s behavior. Many had already internalized the advice. It seemed logical to them that avoiding foods would give children less of a chance to develop allergies. If it was still a good idea not to expose children until they were six months old, why not keep going? A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year turned all of this on its head. Researchers enrolled 640 infants at high risk for allergies, between 4 and 11 months of age, in a trial and randomized them to one of two groups. One of them was to avoid peanut protein the other was to eat at least six grams of peanut protein a week given in three or more meals. All participants were followed until they were 5 years old. What was most surprising in this work was that 15 percent of the infants already had evidence of peanut sensitivity by allergy testing. They were enrolled in the trial despite this, and half of them were given peanut extract every week. The results were remarkable. At the end of the study, about 3 percent of those exposed to peanuts had developed a peanut allergy, compared with more than 17 percent among those who avoided peanuts. More surprising, if you looked just at the children who already had evidence of peanut sensitivity when they were babies, fewer than 11 percent of those regularly exposed to peanuts developed an allergy. But more than 35 percent of those who avoided peanuts developed an allergy. Children who had proven sensitivity to peanuts, but consumed them in their diet regularly, were less likely to develop a peanut allergy than children without sensitivity who avoided them. Recently,   results were published. After the trial ended, researchers asked all the participants who had been regularly consuming peanuts to avoid them for the next 12 months. At the end of that period, when the children were 6, there was no significant increase in new peanut allergies in that group. Avoidance at this point made no difference. The critical need for exposure appears to be somewhere from infancy until age 5. These results were so convincing that, once again, experts are changing their recommendations. In September 2015, the A. A. P.  โ€”   along with others  โ€”   argued that โ€health care providers should recommend introducing   products into the diets of โ€ โ€ infants early on in life. โ€ These changes dovetail nicely within what has become known as the hygiene hypothesis, the gist of which is that as weโ€ve made our environment more and more sterile, our immune systems develop differently than they used to. Without exposure to outside things to fight, our defenses turn inward and toward more benign substances, leading to increased levels of eczema, asthma and allergies. Of course, many people used to die from infections that no longer threaten us because of advances, so no one should take this as a call for living in filth. Nor should anyone take these recent findings as advice to feed babies and small children peanuts and other foods without concern. All changes to an infantโ€s diet, especially in children with allergies, should be done in consultation with a health care professional. As with many things in health care, however, we went too far with our response to peanut and other food allergies. Avoidance is sometimes needed for those with severe reactions. When we apply those same rules to everyone else, however, things can backfire.",0
40,MRI Shows Detailed Images of 20-Week Unborn Babies - Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,"A newly developed MRI scan allows parents to see detailed images of the beating heart of even a   unborn baby, as well as clear pictures of the baby stretching its legs and even swallowing in the womb. [The new scan, developed by a   team of medical researchers, could replace the somewhat grainy ultrasound images parents are more accustomed to viewing during pregnancy.  UK video parenting site ChannelMum is sharing the video, created by the iFind project, which shows an MRI scan of a baby at 20 weeks. Cathy Ranson, who edits the site, says, โ€Scans are amazing as they help mums, dads and even other family members bond with their baby. โ€    โ€There is nothing quite as emotional as seeing your unborn child moving inside you, and these MRI scans are taking images to the next level,โ€ she adds. โ€They are truly breathtaking. โ€ According to the Daily Mail, the new scan is also revving up the abortion debate in the UK once again since, with the new technology, parents and doctors can see clearly how fully formed an unborn baby is at 20 weeks. Currently, the legal abortion limit in the UK is 24 weeks. โ€Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has previously supported slashing the limit to 12 weeks and there have also been calls to reduce it to 20 weeks,โ€ says the report. With a   administration now in the White House in the United States, national leaders who oppose abortion are hoping to pass the   Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban most abortions past the   mark, into law. Dr. David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at Kingโ€s College London who has participated in the project, says, โ€Taking pictures of a 20 week fetus while theyโ€re still in the womb really isnโ€t that easy. โ€ He explains: For one thing, theyโ€re very small. The fetal heart, for example, with all of its tiny chambers and valves, is only about 15mm long: less than the size of penny. Ultrasound technology  โ€”   used in all routine antenatal scans in the UK  โ€”   is actually fairly good at visualising these tiny structures. It uses very high frequency sound waves which are reflected back (โ€echoโ€) from the structures inside the body to produce an image. The MRI scan, unlike an ultrasound, shows what is happening under the babyโ€s skin, so that images can be obtained even of babies who move around frequently. โ€In fetal ultrasound, the images produced can be excellent, but unfortunately, thatโ€s not true for every patient,โ€ Lloyd continues. โ€Ultrasound has to be able to โ€seeโ€ through the body to the parts of the baby we want to image, and that isnโ€t always easy. It will depend on the age of the baby, how they are lying in the womb, the size of the mother, and many other factors. โ€ โ€MRI, which uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images, isnโ€t so limited,โ€ he explains. โ€It can see the structures inside the body regardless of whether thereโ€s bone, muscle or fat in the way and in some cases it can give us even more detailed images than ultrasound. โ€ โ€Importantly, it is also one of the few imaging techniques that is safe to use in pregnancy,โ€ Lloyd adds.",0
41,4 of the Best Kinds of Milk That Arenโ€t Dairy,Alexandria Laredo,"  Now, numerous studies have concluded that milk doesnโ€t actually build bone and provide the same amount of calcium that we thought. A study published in the British Medical Journal , for example, followed more than 100,000 people in Sweden over periods of 20 to 30 years, with shocking results: The people who drank milk were more likely to die from heart disease and cancer. The women suffered more overall fractures and hip fractures as well. Different studies have also shown that higher dairy intake is linked to higher risks of prostate and ovarian cancer and can trigger type 1 diabetes. It is also linked to forms of acne, just to name a few effects. There is also the disturbing side of the dairy industry, where animals are abused to produce the milk we drink. A lot of dairy products are filled with the hormones that were given to female cows to keep them perpetually lactating so they produce an endless flow of milk. This doctor describes it perfectly when he says โ€cowโ€s milk is for baby calfs, just like human milk is for babies.โ€ It is a substance we need while in crucial stages of development, but past a certain age, it becomes obsolete. While there are many alternatives to dairy milk, some are much better than others. Here are some of the better โ€milkโ€ products out there. Almond Milk Raw organic almond milk is a great choice when you know where itโ€s coming from. As with many mass produced products, even some almond milks arenโ€t the best for us. An analysis of a UK almond milk brand showed that nuts make up only 2% of the drink itself. A single serving of almond milk has almost no protein. Compared with plain old almonds, it fares even worse. There is one place where almond milk comes out on top, of course: It has more potassium and more of the vitamins A and D. But almond milk is fortified with these nutrients โ€” theyโ€ve been added during the production process. Making almond milk yourself, however, is a fantastic option, and allows you to control exactly what goes inside it, ensuring there are no additives, preservatives, or substances youโ€ve never even heard of before. Rice Milk Rice milk is another good choice that works well as a dairy substitute, if you donโ€t mind the taste. Itโ€s higher in carbohydrates than other milk choices and contains around the same amount of calcium as cowโ€s milk. Yet it contains almost no protein, so it needs to be balanced with other protein rich foods. During processing, the carbs break down into sugars and give the milk a sweet taste. It is filled with more sugar, around 10 grams for one serving, which is a lot more than something like coconut milk, which has around 3 grams. If youโ€re trying to have as little sugar as possible, rice milk may not be the best choice, but itโ€s certainly better than plain old dairy milk. Coconut Milk Coconut milk is definitely one of the healthier options here. When this milk is all natural, meaning thereโ€s no added sugars, natural flavours, or preservatives, it is incredibly healthy for us. โ€ Coconuts are highly nutritious and rich in fibre, vitamins C, E, B1, B3, B5 and B6 and minerals including iron, selenium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and phosphorous.โ€ The things that makes coconuts so good is the type of fat they contain. They have a form of medium-chain fatty acids rather than long-chain fatty acids, which are stored in our tissue for much longer. One of the beneficial acids within coconuts is called lauric acid. This gets converted inside the body into a beneficial substance called monolaurin acid, which acts as an antiviral agent. But unlike other milks, if you have access, you can go right up to a coconut tree and drink the milk straight from the coconut without the need for processing. This is one of the most pure and fresh ways to get some milk in you! Hemp Milk Ah, hemp; one of the most versatile plants on our planet. Hemp milk has a wide range of health benefits that a lot of other milks donโ€t. Some companies make fully organic, non-GMO, and unsweetened hemp milk, but itโ€s always good to check exactly where youโ€re getting your products from. Hemp milk has a more bean-like and nutty flavor to it, which still tastes great in many drinks or foods. Itโ€s also packed with healthy omega-3 fatty acids, which help with our heart health. In a single 8-ounce glass of hemp milk you can find the following nutrients: Vitamin A",1
42,Ryan Lochte Dropped by Speedo USA and Other Retailers - The New York Times,Katie Rogers,"The fallout from Ryan Lochteโ€s story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio  โ€”   a tale the Brazilian police said was not true  โ€”   continued Monday when four companies said they would end business partnerships with Mr. Lochte, an American swimmer and   Olympic medalist. After a week of intense international media attention and anger in Brazil, the financial repercussions were swift for Mr. Lochte as Speedo USA, the luxury clothing retailer Ralph Lauren and the mattress company Airweave all announced that they would part ways with him. And Syneron Candela, a company that sells   devices, told Reuters its relationship with the swimmer ended on Sunday. Speedo USA said in a message on Twitter that it would instead donate a $50, 000 portion of Mr. Lochteโ€s fee to a charity to help Brazilian children. โ€While we have enjoyed a winning relationship with Ryan for over a decade and he has been an important member of the Speedo team, we cannot condone behavior that is counter to the values this brand has long stood for,โ€ the company said in its statement. On Monday, Kim Angelastro, a spokeswoman for Syneron Candela, wrote in an email, โ€We hold our employees to high standards, and we expect the same of our business partners. โ€ Mr. Lochte was a spokesman for the companyโ€s Gentle Hair Removal brand. Through a spokeswoman, Ralph Lauren said Monday that Mr. Lochteโ€s endorsement agreement with the clothing company had been for only the 2016 Olympics, and that his contract would not be renewed. Airweave said on Twitter that โ€after careful consideration, we have made the decision to end our partnership with Ryan Lochte. โ€ The decisions to cut ties with Mr. Lochte, 32, were the first major signs of the financial fallout for him. For the past week, he has been at the center of an international firestorm after the Brazilian police said he and three other American athletes  โ€”   Jimmy Feigen, Jack Conger and Gunnar Bentz  โ€”   had fabricated the account of being robbed after a   party in Rio de Janeiro. The authorities said that the swimmers had instead drunkenly vandalized a gas station bathroom, paying a security guard about $50 for the damage before leaving. Mr. Lochte originally said that the car they were traveling in had been stopped by armed men, who held a gun to his head. But his story later changed. A Brazilian judge ordered the swimmers to remain in Rio, but Mr. Lochte had already left the country. After Mr. Conger and Mr. Bentz were pulled from their flight to the United States, they told the police that the confrontation began when Lochte pulled a poster off a gas station wall. Mr. Feigen, 26, later donated $10, 800 to a charity in Rio that teaches martial arts to poor children. Mr. Lochte first issued an apology on social media  โ€”   โ€I should have been much more responsible for how I handled myself,โ€ he wrote  โ€”   then told Matt Lauer in an interview on NBC that he had been intoxicated and that he had โ€overexaggerated that story. โ€ He has maintained that he was held at gunpoint. โ€All we know is that there was a gun pointed in our direction, and we were demanded to give money,โ€ Mr. Lochte said. Mr. Lochte, whose boyish and sometimes oafish personality had made him a commercial success in Olympics past, had headed into Rio with fewer sponsors than heโ€d had at the London Games, according to a report by CNN Money. Mr. Lochte took home a gold medal in the   freestyle relay in Rio.",0

44,Conservatives Urge Sessions to Clean Out Obamaโ€s Civil Rights Division - Breitbart,Ian Mason,"A group of attorneys, scholars, and advocates put their names to a letter sent to Attorney General Jeff Sessions Tuesday, urging him to take a serious look at reform as he works with the President to select a new Assistant Attorney General for his Civil Rights Division. [โ€During the Obama administration, the Division served purely ideological ends with rigidity unmatched in other federal offices. Entrenched federal bureaucrats jettisoned precepts like equal enforcement in favor of political and racialized dogmas with a zeal that risks litigation failure and invites court sanctions,โ€ the letter states.  Signed by such conservative heavyweights as Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, the letter paints a picture of a Division ripe for sweeping reform after eight years under Obama during which โ€The Civil Rights Division has relegated its leadership role to political activists. โ€ Hiring practices for the career staff of the Division is one of the letterโ€s chief concerns. While Tom Perez, now head of the Democratic National Committee, was the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, the Division was the subject of an Inspector Generalโ€s review that found the Obama Justice Departmentโ€s insistence that   have a โ€demonstrated commitment to civil rightsโ€ led to a perception only   activists need apply. โ€In this case, perception and reality were synonymous,โ€ the letter insists, noting instances in which Division employees leaked confidential information to civil rights groups, and Perezโ€s subsequent refusal to implement any of the reportโ€s hiring recommendations. Also among the letterโ€s complaints is the alleged culture of politically motivated bullying that was fostered during the Obama years. The same Inspector Generalโ€s Report found a pattern of personal attacks against, for example, employees who were โ€openly Christian. โ€ J. Christian Adams, President of the Public Interest Legal Foundation and a signatory of the letter, added, โ€For years, a radicalized Civil Rights Division   advanced leftists causes with respect to voting, law enforcement, immigration, and others while constitutional Rule of Law was considered a nuisance. General Sessions has an opportunity to begin the course correction necessary to protect all Americans from civil rights abuses. โ€ In picking a new head for the Civil Rights Division, the letterโ€s signatories hope Attorney General Sessions will look for a reformer prepared to return to   civil rights enforcement and tackle the Divisionโ€s entrenched cultural problems. โ€The next AAG certainly cannot be a proponent of the status quo by any means,โ€ they say.",0
45,Internal Inquiry Sealed the Fate of Roger Ailes at Fox - The New York Times,"Jim Rutenberg, Ben Protess and Emily Steel","Executives at 21st Century Fox decided to end the tenure of Roger Ailes after lawyers they hired to investigate an allegation of sexual harassment against him took statements from at least six other women who described inappropriate behavior from Mr. Ailes, two people briefed on the inquiry said Wednesday. One of the people said that the details of the allegations, while unverified, were troubling enough that they left 21st Century Fox little choice but to force an end to Mr. Ailesโ€s reign as chairman and chief executive of Fox News, given the potential liability they presented to the company both legally and in terms of its own corporate culture. The people with knowledge of the state of discussions over Mr. Ailesโ€s exit agreement said both sides were working toward an accommodation that would recognize Mr. Ailesโ€s service to the company as the founder and leader of Fox News, which sits atop the cable news ratings and is a major profit engine for 21st Century Fox. The agreement could also include a provision for him to continue with Fox as a consultant. But given the personalities and complications involved, the situation was fluid enough that no accommodation had been reached by Wednesday night. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the discussions or on the investigation, which is being conducted by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison. Lawyers for Mr. Ailes did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the allegations of sexual harassment and more than a dozen Fox News staff members, including some top stars, have publicly supported him. The people briefed on the investigation, who would not speak for attribution because of the sensitivity of the investigation, stressed that it was narrowly focused on the allegations against Mr. Ailes, and not the broader climate at the network. But Mr. Ailesโ€s departure will have much wider implications. Given Fox Newsโ€s place as a central hub for conservative opinion  โ€”   not to mention as a primary outlet for the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump  โ€”   the shape of its   operation goes beyond corporate intrigue at 21st Century Fox, and could have consequences for the national political dialogue. In the two weeks since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox anchor, filed suit against Mr. Ailes, the Murdoch family, which runs 21st Century Fox, has made it clear that its decision to take the allegations seriously was in keeping with its desire to follow modern standards for office conduct, and that these needed to extend to Fox News, as well. The question in the   environment is to what extent the Murdochs decide to continue on with Mr. Ailesโ€s current management team. That, in turn, could determine the future approach and look of the network, which is the outlet of choice for   viewers seeking an alternative to the mainstream media. Speculation about who Mr. Ailesโ€s successor would be transfixed the media world on Wednesday, with focus on outsiders such as the CBS News president, David Rhodes, who had worked at Fox News for several years one of Mr. Ailesโ€s current lieutenants, like Bill Shine or Michael Clemente the New York Post chief executive Jesse Angelo or someone from conservative media like Christopher Ruddy, the founder and chief executive of Newsmax Media Inc. At least for the day, fears that some of Fox Newsโ€s   stars, like Bill Oโ€Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren, would exercise contract clauses to leave with Mr. Ailesโ€s loss of his chairmanship, appeared to abate. Network staff members were acutely focused on Megyn Kelly, who had hinted in recent months she wanted to leave the network. She was one of the women who told Paul, Weiss investigators that Mr. Ailes had acted improperly with her, one of the people briefed on the inquiry said Tuesday. Ms. Kelly maintained her silence on Wednesday. But as the end of Mr. Ailesโ€s chairmanship approached, it appeared to embolden other women to discuss their own experiences at the network. Several spoke with reporters on condition that they not be named. In interviews, several current and former Fox News employees said inappropriate comments about a womanโ€s appearance and her sex life were frequent in the newsroom. The newsroom has been on edge in the weeks since Ms. Carlson filed her suit, one person said. Everybody wants to talk about the drama but nobody wants to talk in the open, the person said. As of Wednesday evening, staff members had not received an email from 21st Century Fox, Fox News or Mr. Ailes informing them about the events that have transpired, the investigation or the future of the network. The swift pace of events at Fox News  โ€”   only two weeks passed between Ms. Carlsonโ€s filing of her lawsuit and the negotiations to end Mr. Ailesโ€s leadership  โ€”   were especially surprising for a network that has made its name by embracing โ€politically incorrectโ€ themes, something in keeping with the brash personalities of both Mr. Ailes and the 21st Century Fox patriarch, Rupert Murdoch. Female hosts in skirts, sitting behind translucent desks that can highlight their legs, have always been a network trademark. To completely move away from that ethos would be to fundamentally change the network. And 21st Century Foxโ€s leadership will have to be mindful of maintaining its special relationship with viewers that Mr. Ailes has so carefully cultivated, and which is central to the financial and ratings success of the network. Mr. Murdoch will ultimately determine that direction in close consultation  โ€”   and perhaps even some deference  โ€”   to the two sons he is grooming to succeed him, Lachlan and James Murdoch. The latter, at least, is known to have different politics from his father. So far, none of the three has made any public statement about the network, its future or, for that matter, Mr. Ailes.",0
46,"Press TV Debate: Duff on Lebanon, Hezbollah and Aounโ€s Presidency (3 videos)","Gordon Duff, Senior Editor","By Gordon Duff, Senior Editor on November 2, 2016 Understanding Lebanon and the political realignment there critical to US understanding of the region...and to our future with Israel 
Lebanon has a new president. The political development puts an end to over two years of power vacuum in the country. On Monday, lawmakers voted to pick General Michel Aoun as Lebanonโ€s 13th president. The election is seen as a victory for the resistance movement Hezbollah, especially after Saad Hariri, the leader of the March 14 Alliance and a close ally of Saudi Arabia, voiced his support for Aoun. On this edition of โ€The Debate,โ€ Press TV has asked two analysts why they believe Hariri threw his weight behind Aoun. 
Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, praised Haririโ€s measure, adding that with this decision, he actually wanted to bring stability back to Lebanon and thus avoid Syriaโ€s spillover effects. 
Hariri is a shrewd politician who represents an important segment of the Lebanese society, Mikhail said, adding that by his vote for General Aoun, he aimed to take the country out of the current political deadlock and, ultimately, save it from the repercussions of the Syrian war. 
Mikhail believes that the United Statesโ€ shrinking power in the Middle East has forced Hariri to face away from Washington. 
โ€I believe that Saad Hariri could have been motivated, along with others, about a vision that Americaโ€s role in the Middle East is receding. So, perhaps Russia is the new reality in the Middle East, is a new power. So, anything that is somehow close to Russia will be better for Lebanon,โ€ Mikhail argued. 
Mikhail said that โ€so many things have transpired inside Lebanon and inside the Arab region within this year. I would assume that the Syrian civil war and its severity and brutality has convinced him that he can maintain good ties with the [Persian] Gulf states but at the same time study the strategic realities.โ€ 
โ€He (Hariri) sees that Syria has to be stable in order for Lebanon to be stable. So, he is making calculations. I hope none of them is a miscalculation because the area cannot afford any other catastrophe. So, he displayed again very well maintaining some sort of balance between his Syrian interests and [Persian] Gulf interests and perhaps he can formulate some equilibrium about this.โ€ The image grab shows Gordon Duff (L), a senior editor of Veterans Today based in Ohio, and Nabil Mikhail, a professor at The George Washington University, at Press TVโ€s โ€The Debateโ€ show on Monday night. 
Meanwhile, the other guest on the show, Gordon Duff, the editor of Veterans Today , noted that, in his view, the reason behind Hezbollahโ€s victory in Michel Aounโ€s election is the movementโ€s victories in Syria, especially in Aleppo, which has made it more powerful than ever and has paved the way for domestic victories. 
โ€If Aleppo falls, and Aleppo will fall, itโ€s only a matter of how long, a victorious and highly-disciplined, highly-trained Hezbollah force, [which is] heavily trained by Russia and by Iran, is going to return to Lebanon. Itโ€s a very different force and I believe Hariri is looking at this. Reaching out for what should be a very different Hezbollah could lead to stabilization of the political process in Lebanon that has been out of control,โ€ Duff reiterated. Related Posts:",1

48,"Samsung, After Combustible Galaxy Note 7, Unveils New Smartphone - The New York Times",Brian X. Chen,"SAN FRANCISCO  โ€”   Dogged by combustible smartphones and recalls of other devices, Samsung Electronics is hoping to find a path to product redemption. The South Korean company on Wednesday introduced the Galaxy S8, its first major smartphone release since the scandal over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were discontinued last year after some of the devices spontaneously caught fire. โ€Itโ€s been a challenging year for Samsung,โ€ said D. J. Koh, the companyโ€s head of mobile devices, adding that Samsung was ready to start anew. The Galaxy S8 features a large 5.  screen without adding bulk to the device. The company said it made room for the screen by reducing the size of the bezel  โ€”   or the forehead and the chin  โ€”   on the face of the device. Samsung also made the home button into a virtual button and shoved it under the display. With the Galaxy S8, Samsung also rolled out its virtual assistant, Bixby, to rival Appleโ€s Siri, Googleโ€s Assistant and Amazonโ€s Alexa. Similar to previous virtual assistants, Bixby responds to voice commands. Time  โ€”   and sales  โ€”   will tell whether the Galaxy S8 will restore confidence in Samsungโ€s smartphones. Last year, after the company received dozens of complaints about the Galaxy Note 7 overheating, and in some cases exploding, the company recalled the phones. But replacement phones continued to catch fire, and the company had to recall the devices a second time before killing the product altogether, sacrificing billions of dollars in revenue. The Galaxy Note 7 may still make a reappearance. On Monday, Samsung said that it might sell refurbished versions of the phone. Jan Dawson, an independent analyst for Jackdaw Research, said the Galaxy S8 could help Samsung recover as long as the product worked reliably. โ€Note 7 definitely did some damage to the Samsung brand, especially for people who had little or no personal experience with Samsung devices,โ€ he said. โ€But as long as the S8 does well and doesnโ€t suffer from any of the same problems, the memories of the Note 7 issues will fade and Samsung will recover well.โ€ Samsung last year also issued a separate recall for 2. 8 million washing machines in the United States. The machines were prone to detaching from the washing machine chassis, posing a risk of injury. The Galaxy S8 will arrive in stores next month with a starting price of $750.",0
49,Poland Vows Referendum on Migrant Quota Amidst EU Pressure: โ€The Publicโ€s Voice Will Be Heardโ€ - Breitbart,Virginia Hale,"โ€The publicโ€s voice will be heard,โ€ Polandโ€s president declared, as he vowed a referendum on the European Unionโ€s (EU) migrant quota amidst growing pressure from Brussels. [Describing the question of whether Poland should be forced to accept a quota of migrants from the third world as โ€of vital importanceโ€ for its future security, Andrzej Duda said the referendum could be held during parliamentary elections in 2019.  โ€That would allow the new government to hear the clear voice of the nation on the issue,โ€ said the president. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) governmentโ€s position on the quota system is โ€clear and unambiguousโ€ Duda said. He said maintaining the party โ€does not agree with the [plan] and asserted that โ€Poland does not consent to the forced relocation of refugees on our territoryโ€. Holding a referendum will also enable the publicโ€s voice to be heard over the voices of international organisations, Duda asserted. โ€If Brussels continues to raise [the issue of migration] attempting to exert pressure and force on the Polish authorities, then public opinion will be extremely important,โ€ Duda promised. Polandโ€s latest display of opposition to the redistribution plan comes as the Czech Republic announced its withdrawal from the scheme, which has been fiercely contested in Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary and Slovakia challenging the plans in court. In an interview with Czech tabloid Blesk published Tuesday, EU president   Juncker demanded all nations in Europe shoulder โ€solidarity and responsibilityโ€ when it comes to migration. Brussels was left humiliated last year when Hungarians were asked what they thought of EU plans to force on their nation migrants from the third world, as 95 per cent said they rejected the scheme. Earlier this month, Breitbart London reported that senior Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki announced the โ€only proven methodโ€ to avoid Islamist terror attacks is not to import Muslim migrants. โ€When it comes to reducing the chances of Poland being hit by [Islamist] terror attacks, the only proven method is to not allow in Muslim migrants,โ€ the MEP told local radio after the London Bridge terror attack, which killed eight and injured at least 48 others.",0
50,Sparking An Inner Revolution,Lance Schuttler,"0 0 With humanityโ€s awakening continuing to speed up as every day passes, we see more and more people desiring information to help them better themselves. Whether that is done through eating healthier foods, beginning a yoga or meditation practice, or whether it is done by being more mindful with the words they choose to use when having an inner dialogue or a conversation with friends and family, more people are looking for information to help them transform their lives in a positive way. While there are many methods to improving oneโ€s life, below are some methods that can help a person spark an inner revolution to create positive and uplifting change in his or her world. Grounding/Earthing Grounding, or what is also called Earthing is when a person has bare skin touching the Earth or a tree and is most commonly done by standing on the Earth with oneโ€s bare feet. Doing this begins to balance the electrochemical state of the body because of the negative ions the Earth emits. Negative ions act as antioxidants (free-radical scavengers) by pairing up with the free radicals and rendering them neutral. Thus, pain, inflammation and anything out of balance begins to move towards balance, or homeostasis. There have been several studies that have shown how grounding helps with pain reduction, wounding healing, balancing of the circadian rhythm to help improve sleep, as well as helping to shift a personโ€s brainwaves to the alpha state, which is great for a calm and balanced, yet alert and fully awake state of mind. Standing barefoot on the Earth, sand, dirt or concrete (not asphalt) will allow the free flow of negative ions to come in contact with the sensory neurons on the skin and begin to trigger positive physiological and psychological changes within the body. Taking it a bit further, if a person is able to connect with the Earth in a quiet place, the benefits could be even more as Dr. Joe Dispenza has said , โ€In clinical studies, we have proven that 2 hours of nature sounds a day significantly reduce stress hormones up to 800% and activates 500-600 DNA segments known to be responsible for healing and repairing the body.โ€ Burning Sage In a 2007 study from the Journal of Ethnopharmacology , researchers found that medicinal smoke killed harmful airborne bacteria by up to 94% in just one hour. On a more spiritual level, burning sage has long been used to clear negative or disharmonious energies from a space. This can be done when a person comes home from work or school for that day, as burning sage can be a good way to clear any discordant energy the person may have โ€picked upโ€ or had โ€taken onโ€ from other people or their environment. It is used to clear away such energy so that a person can be centered in who he or she is, rather than having to deal with issues that might have been taken on from others. I personally do this each time after coming home from getting groceries or running and errand. Essential Oils The two best ways to use essential oils are to smell them as well as apply them to the skin. While applying essential oils to the skin has many of itโ€s own benefits, smelling them also creates wonderful responses in the body, and especially the brain. According to the University of Minnesota , smelling essential oilsโ€ molecules affect the olfactory organs, the lungs (and thus the respiratory system) as well as the brain. Odor molecules travel through the nose and positively affect the limbic system of the brain, which is sometimes called the โ€emotional part of the brain.โ€ To this end, the limbic system controls heart rate, mood, blood pressure, memory, breathing, stress hormone response and overall stress levels. Applying or smelling essential oils throughout the day is a wonderful way to develop emotional intelligence and can help a person respond to stressful situations in a more positive way than before. Smelling essential oils can be personally described as an uplifting and heavenly experience; one that allows us to smell the cosmic byproduct of thousands of flowers pressed into a wonderful gift for humanity. Breathing Exercises Breathing exercises, which can also be considered a form of meditation, can have profound effects on the body and mind. According to Deepok Chopra , a regular practice of rhythmic deep breathing has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, stabilize blood pressure, increase energy levels and decrease feelings of stress. Over time, a breathing or meditation practice can lead to wonderful internal shifts both physically and emotionally. Incorporating a deep breathing practice into the practice of grounding or Earthing is a great way to accomplish both practices at once. Here is an article of three sample breathing exercises from Dr. Andrew Weil. While there are many other practices a person can use to help catalyze deeper inner growth, such as flower essence therapy (different from essential oils), nature walking, sun-bathing and the use of certain health supplements like fulvic acid and Reishi , this list is a guide that may help those who may just be starting to experience an internal transformation. These four simple practices can be easy to incorporate into oneโ€s life and is recommended to experiment with what feels best for that person. What of these practices do you use in your life? What other practices do you use to help you continue your inner revolution? Share with us your practices or suggestions you have in the comments section. Cheers to our health!

51,Dueling Drills Further Increase NATO Russia Tensions,nan,"Dueling Drills Further Increase NATO Russia Tensions November 03, 2016 Dueling Drills Further Increase NATO Russia Tensions 
Irked by NATO's disaster-relief drills in Montenegro, Russia held special forces exercises with its Balkan neighbour Serbia on Wednesday. In Montenegro, which split from Serbia a decade ago, NATO is on Friday due to wrap up a five-day disaster-relief drill of 680 unarmed personnel from seven NATO members and 10 partner countries including Serbia. ""It is in the interest of Montenegro, in the interest of NATO, and also in the interest of the region, to be part of NATO and promote Euro-Atlantic values in the Balkans, and these values benefit each and every one of us,"" Montenegro's deputy Prime Minister Dusko Markovic , said about the exercise. Across the border, in Serbia, Russia flew in its paratroopers along with allied Belarus for an exercise called ""Slavic Brotherhood"", which according the Serbian defence ministry focuses on ""fighting terrorism"". 
The drills are set to last until November 9 and will include 212 Russian, 450 Serbian and 56 Belarusian troops. Three Russian transport planes have already landed in Belgrade on Wednesday bringing in soldiers and equipment. 
Drills in the two former Yugoslav republics reflect mounting tensions between Russia and the West over a variety of geopolitical issues including conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.

In Serbia, NATO is hugely unpopular after its 1999 bombing ousted Belgrade's armed forces out of its former southern province of Kosovo. 
But as part of its integrations with the West, Serbia last year signed the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP), the highest level of cooperation between NATO and a country not aspiring to join. 
An EU candidate, Serbia insists that it is militarily neutral, but maintains close ties with Russia, its Orthodox Christian and Slavic superpower ally, the biggest gas and oil source and an obstacle to Kosovo's membership in the United Nations. 
Last year Montenegro accepted an invitation to join NATO, a move that soured relations withRussia. Ahead of October's parliamentary vote Montenegro's outgoing Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic accused Moscow of meddling in country's elections and of financing the opposition. A fifth of the votes in the poll went to an anti-NATO, pro-Serbia bloc. Article by Doc Burkhart , Vice-President, General Manager and co-host of TRUNEWS with Rick Wiles Got a news tip?

52,Study: More Than Half of Car Crashes Involve Drivers Distracted by Cell Phones - Breitbart,Nate Church,"A new study found that 52% of roadside accidents involved drivers distracted by their phones. [Apparently, being in sole control of one of the   aluminum shells hurtling at high speed on Americaโ€s roads isnโ€t enough to hold driversโ€ attention. Traffic deaths have jumped by 14% since 2014, according to Cambridge Mobile Telematics, which conducted the study. The research firm found that 52% of accidents involved drivers who were distracted by their phones.    phone use while driving laws have done little to curb the habits of its citizens. Only fourteen states have banned handheld use of phones while driving, and only twenty prohibit phone use by school bus drivers a single state bans bus drivers from texting. But Cambridge Mobile Telematicsโ€ Chief Technology Officer, Hari Balakrishnan, has hope: Distracted driving due to smartphone use is intuitively blamed for the increase in road crashes and claims. Whatโ€s less intuitive is that smartphones hold the solution to the problem they created. Drivers now have access to tools that analyze their driving and achieve real behavioral change through immediate and ongoing feedback. Balakrishnan called distracted driving โ€one of the most urgent public safety problems facing our communities todayโ€ and stressed the importance of taking a โ€critical look at how we can most effectively reduce the danger that drivers face. โ€ CMT is working to do their part. Their DriveWell app both monitors drivers and encourages safer driving habits. The site claims that โ€users see an average reduction of 35% in phone distraction, 20% in hard braking, and 20% in   speeding all within less than 30 days of using the program. โ€ Their goals are best summed up by Balakrishnan himself: โ€By harnessing the very technology that threatens driver safety, and using it to help drivers understand and improve their behavior, weโ€re making the world safer by the day. โ€ Follow Nate Church @Get2Church on Twitter for the latest news in gaming and technology, and snarky opinions on both.",0

55,The Trump Election Will Spark More Individual & Collective Healing,Lance Schuttler,"The Trump Election Will Spark More Individual & Collective Healing Nov 9, 2016 1 0 
This article will not be a pro-Trump or a pro-Hillary piece. It will have little to do with politics and more to do with a much bigger picture. As everyone knows, many people are celebrating the Trump victory and many people are mourning it. What is needed right now is a wider perspective at what is occurring. Donald Trump will become the next U.S. President. 
With Donald Trump set to take over the Oval Office in late January of 2017, there are many unknowns, just as it would be if Hillary would have won. 
What is going to happen with health insurance? What is going to happen with immigration laws? What is going to happen with foreign policy in relation to other nations? More importantly, what is going to happen to us as individuals and humanity as a whole? 
Individual Healing 
While these questions need to be asked and will in time be answered, we must remember that we cannot give up our personal power to shape our individual lives. Right now, many people are worried and many people are thrilled. Regardless of our feelings on this election, we must remember that we alone are responsible for our individual lives as we make countless choices each day. How will I choose to treat others today? How will I choose to treat myself today? Am I taking care of my physical body well by eating well and exercising enough? Am I ensuring to get enough sleep throughout the week? What is it I can do today to become a better person? By either believing that one person is going to save or change your entire life or by believing that one person is going to ruin your entire life gives away your own personal power. The great philosopher Epictetus once said , โ€It is not what happens to you, it is how you respond.โ€ We always have a choice in our response to any situation. 
By either being saddened or thrilled at the perception that one man is going to either ruin or save your life is extremely dis-empowering. Though each person has every right to feel how they want, it must be remembered where true power comes from: within . Every person has the choice how they wish to respond to this election. Are you going to wither away in frustration, anger and despair or are you going to make choices that help you to become the best person you can be? On the opposite side, are you going to sit back and believe your personal challenges are going to be fixed with a new president or are you also going to take action to become the best person you can be? Regardless of who you did or didnโ€t support, we all need to reclaim our personal power and continue the trek towards bettering and healing ourselves, even if it is in the smallest of ways. 
Collective Healing 
On a wider scale, this election will give us the collective choice to where we wish to travel. Do we wish to seek peace with other people and other countries? Do we wish to have dialogue with nations previous administrations demonized? Do we wish to communicate with and try to understand other peopleโ€s viewpoints or are we going to remain closed off to such opportunities for personal and collective healing and growth? 
Additionally, are we going to continue to allow group-think to dominate our society by letting the media tell us what to believe, or are we going to begin gathering information from several sources to arrive at our own conclusions? Are we going to question our leaders more and demand answers that are truthful and unbiased towards any specific agenda? Will we do this both on a local and mass level? Are we going to work towards cooperation or continue to live in a dying paradigm of competition? 
As physicist and author Gregg Braden says , โ€A growing body of scientific evidence, gathered from more than 400 peer-reviewed studies, is leading to an undeniable truth: violent competition and war directly contradict our deepest instincts of cooperation and nurturing. Scientific studies show conclusively that nature is based upon a model of cooperation and mutual aid, not violent competition and war. We live in a world where everything is connected. We can no longer think in terms of us and them when it comes to the consequences of the way we live. Today itโ€s all about WE .โ€ Science has disproved Darwinโ€s theory and shows us we must act in unison to transcend our collective challenges. 
I see this election as many other do: a massive turning point in our worldโ€s evolution. I personally have full trust that we will look back at this time and see this as a positive, yet challenging event in that it empowered more people to begin taking action to create the kind of world they wish to live in. This turning point is allowing us all to shift our perception of the world and to initiate action towards creating a more peaceful, happy and abundant world for all.

57,Cognition and True Islam - A Book Review,M.R. Islam,"1 Shares

Book Review โ€“ Dr. Rafiq Islam, Emertec R&D Ltd; Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia
 Book title: True Islam, Jihad, and Terrorism: The Science of Islamic Foreign Policy โ€“ Jaan S. Islam
 Publisher: New York: Nova Science Publishers
 ISBN 978-1-63485-542-6.
 At a time of politics of fear, Jaan Islam counters fear with knowledge in his masterpiece, True Islam, Jihad and Terrorism (Nova Science Publishers, New York, 2016). During the 2016 US election, it has become clear world peace and security is connected to the state of Islam and how it is understood in todayโ€s context. This is a very timely book that fills a gap in the western society about Islamic history, philosophy, and political science. This book presents the Islamic political philosophy as represented in the writings of great Muslim thinkers and scholars such as Ibn Khaldun. Jaan Islam uses the so-called โ€Islamic cognition techniqueโ€ and starts the book with a chapter dedicated to Islamic cognition. This chapter on cognition itself is a paradigm shift in the modern research scholarship and can be considered for advancing knowledge in other fields. Such an extension was first pointed by Islam, Zatzman and Islam (2013) in their ground-breaking work on educational curriculum.
MORE... Stop using millenary religions as a scapegoat for the crimes of Modern Imperialism Another Ramadan for Muslims amid sufferings A conversation on equality, integration and Islam as a religious marker An open letter to young Muslims everywhere: The seed of triumph in every adversity Following the tradition of early Islamic scholars, Jaan Islam presented all theories in the book with evidence from the primary Islamic sources, Qur'an and authenticated traditions of the prophet . These sources were completely ignored in the in the Orientalist (now it has morphed into neo-Orientalism) writings, which led to the inundation of the post 9/11 world with disinformation and agenda-driven โ€researchโ€ about Islamic history. The distinction between this book and these agenda-driven ones gives the book a special value.
 Although the book explains the Islamic foundations of political science and governance, it should not be looked at as a book of theology. It is a dogma-free approach that has been characterized as truly scientific elsewhere . Quite appropriately, the author starts off with a brilliant narration of Islamic cognition. It has been all but forgotten in the west that Islam is the religion that started the tradition of dogma-free, truly scientific cognition. The west does recognize Averrรถes, the famous Islamic scholar as the father of secular philosophy, whereas brands Islam as just another religion, similar to Christianity, infected with doctrinal philosophy. It is no surprise that with that starting point, Islam remains the most misunderstood religion in the west.
Chapter 3 of the book deals with fundamental philosophies of three major philosophers, namely Hobbes, Locke and Ibn Khaldun. In this chapter, the author debunks another myth, that is Ibn Khaldunโ€s political theory is somehow similar to those of Hobbes and Locke. Ibn Khaldun, the father of social science, indeed had a very different starting point in his cognition. The author points out how Ibn Khaldunโ€s first premise was Shahadah that formed the basis of the cognition axis by using Qurโ€an as the origin and prophet Muhammadโ€s life (through the book of Hadith) as the pivotal point. One the other hand, Locke had placed himself as the pivotal point, whereas Hobbes eliminated any cognition point. The author makes it clear that both Hobbesโ€ and Lockeโ€s cognition tools are just as illogical as dogmatic cognition. In my researched opinion, this accurate distinction has not been made by any other author on the topic. It is because the eastern authors do not know about Hobbes and Locke and the western authors do not know about Islamic cognition that was obviously alive and well with Ibn Khaldun.
In Chapter 4, the author uses the case laws of the prophet and his four rightly guided caliphs (known as Rashedun Caliphs). Clearly, the authorโ€s intention is to understand how the prophet and his closest followers went to war or which verses of the Qurโ€an they were enacting. For the first time anyone took this approach and not surprisingly, the author comes up with four rigid criteria from the Qurโ€an. No other author to the best of my knowledge connected them to specific wars that the prophet and his companions engaged in. This finding helps the author establish jus ad bellum that can explain every war that shaped the foundation of the young Islamic state of the time.
Similar to Chapter 4, the author discovers jus ad bello in Islamic jurisprudence in Chapter 5. Once again, the case laws are presented and analyzed in such a manner, one can take any new example and evaluate it to call it permissible or not. The theoretical basis for critiquing any modern warfare is set in this chapter.
In Chapter 6, the author addresses a difficult topic. When is it allowed or even mandatory to rebel against a head of state? It is often stated that Islam is a complete code of life. The author makes it clear that Islam didnโ€t leave anything to imagination and has left a strict criterion and modus operandi for any imaginable crisis that can occur at any time. The important question arises as to when a head of state that once claimed to have divine authority can be removed or when a head of state can be declared unfit and it becomes mandatory for the citizens to remove him or wage war if necessary. This is not an easy topic to cover even in todayโ€s world. The author covers it with dexterity from an epoch he considers as exemplary. The history is not pretty and there is room for controversy as often the history is written by the victor and clearly after the demise of the rightly guided Caliphate, the victors were no longer rightly guided. The author weaves through this difficult process and makes it clear for the readership. This chapter can be an eye opener even for a student of Islam that has spent lifetime on the topic.
Often when Islamic criteria are discussed, eyes roll and eye brows furrow in disbelief. If it is all that simple, why donโ€t Islamic scholars have consensus? The author handles this topic like a pro. In Chapter 7, he analyzes current Islamic scholars and deconstructs their thought process. He has kind words for some but has nothing but scorn for the self-righteous, apologist โ€scholarsโ€ that have done great disservice to Islam and/or scientific cognition process. One doesnโ€t have to be personal, but the writing is so clear, one can hardly afford to not get angry at certain genre of scholars. To anyoneโ€s surprise, this list is not made out of anti-Islamic non-Muslim scholars.
Chapter 8 is where proof of the pudding appears. The author analyzes every major event of todayโ€s political arena and analyzes it with the Islamic criteria of both jus ad bello and jus ad bellum. The author comes up with an index to rank various countries and groups. Most interesting is the discussion on current US allies, such as Saudi Arabia, and how they rank among the biggest offenders of Islam and Islamic laws. This is not a topic for the faint of heart but the author did an excellent job making it easily readable, punctuated with numerous riveting arguments.
Chapter 9 is the conclusion and recommendation. I have studied Islam for some 30 years and yet I found these conclusions novel and entirely logical. I doubt anyone would agree with the conclusions unless of course that person reads the entire book prior to reading the conclusion. It is important to read the book in sequence.
Chapter 10 lists the bibliography and references. It is many pages long and is quite comprehensive.
Chapter 11 is the Appendix that lists the letters of the prophet. It is a great idea to give the letters in original Arabic, so there is no room for misinterpretation, let alone disinformation.
Anyone with knowledge of Islam knows that Jihad is in the core of Islam and this book shows it is so and there needs to be no apology. Quite interestingly, the author even depicts Jihad as the roof of Islam. Without the roof, the Fort of Islam has no protection whatsoever. This depiction captures the essence of protection, security, as well as integrity and puts away the notion of Jihad being a weapon for Crusade like aggression.
This book belongs to the desk of any researcher interested in knowing about Islam or what Islam can do to bring about peace on earth in order to live out the true meaning of the word, Islam that means peace through submission to the creator. This book is equally useful for anyone interested in pursuit of peace and harmony that is truly elusive in todayโ€s world. In this sense, this book is a manual for world governance in peace.",1

Are we about to see the largest election day miracle of all time? 

From Michael Snyder : 
Because as I will show in this article, that is precisely what it is going to take in order for Donald Trump to win. Before I go any further, I want to make it exceedingly clear that I am not saying what the outcome will be on November 8th. As I recently told a national television audience, I do not know who is going to win. 
In this article I am simply going to examine the poll numbers and the electoral map as they currently stand. But in this bizarre election things can literally change overnight, and it is entirely possible that we could still have another โ€October surpriseโ€ or two before it is all said and done. And without a doubt Donald Trump desperately needs something โ€to move the needleโ€, because if the election was held today Hillary Clinton would almost certainly win. 
What we have witnessed so far during the 2016 election season has been absolutely unprecedented. Just consider some of the things that we have seen up to this point in time. 
We have never had a bigger โ€October surpriseโ€ than the release of the lewd audio tape from 11 years ago in which Donald Trump claimed to grope women without their consent. 
We have never seen the mainstream media openly attack a presidential candidate as much as they have attacked Donald Trump. In the past, the big mainstream news outlets at least pretended to be fair and balanced, but this year they have completely discarded all notions of objectivity. 
They should be completely and utterly ashamed of themselves, and no matter who wins the election they will never be able to get their integrity back. 
We have also never seen a major party at war with itself this close to a presidential election. It has been said that a house divided against itself will surely fall, and a whole host of prominent Republican leaders have been openly attempting to sabotage the Trump campaign. 
If Donald Trump is able to overcome all of these factors, it truly will be a miracle of Biblical proportions. 
As it stands at the moment, however, the numbers are looking quite ominous for Trump. Right now, the Real Clear Politics average of national polls has Hillary Clinton ahead by 6.2 percent. Most political experts consider that to be an insurmountable lead at this stage in the game. 
But even if Trump can close that gap and pull ahead, that does not mean that he will win the election. In fact, Trump could beat Clinton by millions of votes nationally and still lose. 
In order to win the election, one candidate has got to get to 270 electoral votes. And on the latest Real Clear Politics electoral map, 262 electoral votes are being projected to go to Hillary Clinton, 164 electoral votes are being projected to go to Donald Trump, and 112 electoral votes are in the โ€toss upโ€ category. 
So unless something dramatically changes, Donald Trump is essentially going to have to run the table in all of the closely contested states in order to win, and the mathematical odds of that happening are extremely slim. 
Letโ€s take a closer look at this. The first thing that Donald Trump is going to have to do in order to get to 270 electoral votes is to win all of the states that Mitt Romney won in 2012. That would get him up to 206 electoral votes. 
Unfortunately, it looks like that may be very difficult to do. Romney won North Carolina, but the six most recent polls all have Clinton ahead in that state. Romney also won Arizona, but the most recent poll to be taken there has Clinton ahead by five points. 
But for a moment, letโ€s assume that Trump can win all of the states that Romney won. On top of that, there are four other states that Trump must winโ€ฆ 
#1 Trump must win Floridaโ€s 29 electoral votes. Without Florida, Trump has no realistic path to 270 electoral votes. So on election night if it is announced that Trump has lost Florida, you might as well turn off your television and go to bed because Trump is going to lose the election. 
Unfortunately for Trump, four recent major surveys all show Trump down by four points in the Sunshine state. 
#2 Trump must win Ohioโ€s 18 electoral votes. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio, and the two most recent major surveys show that Trump and Clinton are tied in the state. 
#3 Trump must win Iowaโ€s 6 electoral votes. Fortunately for Trump, most recent surveys show him actually leading in Iowa. 
#4 Trump must win Nevadaโ€s 6 electoral votes. At this point that is looking like it will be very tough to do, because all of the recent polls have Clinton leading in Nevada, including the most recent one that has her up by 7 points. 
If Donald Trump can win those four states, that still does not get him to 270 electoral votes. Instead, it gets him to 265 electoral votes, and so he would still need one more medium-sized state to win. 
The most likely candidates for that last state are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota. Unfortunately for Trump, Clinton appears to have big leads in all four of those states right at this moment. 
But even if Trump can somehow pull off a miracle and squeak past the 270 electoral vote mark, the truth is that Utah could still mess everything up. 
Do you remember Evan McMullin? 
He was the third party โ€conservative alternativeโ€ candidate that was hyped for a couple of days but that seemingly fell off the map afterwards. 
He is only on the ballot in 12 states, but one of those states is Utah, and it turns out that Evan McMullin is a Mormon. 
Many Mormons believe that a Mormon will be elected president someday when the U.S. Constitution hangs โ€like a threadโ€. According to this belief, this Mormon president will turn the country around and all sorts of wonderful things will start to happen. Many Mormons thought that Mitt Romney was going to be this president, but now Evan McMullin has become the target of these expectations. 
So how in the world could Evan McMullin become president? 
Well, their plan is to have Evan McMullin win Utah, and that could potentially keep both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton from both getting to 270 electoral votes if the election is super close. If that happens, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives. 
It is being projected that the House will still be controlled by the Republicans after this election, and so the choice would come down to either Trump or McMullin, and those backing McMullin believe that he would have a realistic shot in that scenario. 
I know all of this sounds very strange, but this is actually being discussed around family dinner tables all over Utah tonight. 
And in recent days Evan McMullin has been soaring in Utah. One recent survey shows Trump with a one point lead over McMullin, and another recent survey actually show McMullin leading Trump by four points in the state. 
So Trump could pull off a miracle and do everything else that he needs to do to get to 270 electoral votes, and Utah could end up messing up everything for him. 
In addition, it is also very important to keep in mind that Trump could actually get all of the legitimate votes that he needs to win and still have it stolen from him by election fraud. There was widespread evidence of โ€funny businessโ€ in 2012, and this is something that I detailed for a live studio audience down at Morningsideearlier this monthโ€ฆ 
Are you starting to see why I would consider this to be the biggest miracle in American political history if Donald Trump actually overcomes all of these factors and wins the election? 
And we donโ€t have to wait until November 8th to get some indications about how the vote is going to go. Early voting is already taking place is some states, and so far the signs are not encouraging for the Trump campaign. The following comes from CNNโ€ฆ 
Democratic early turnout has stayed steady in North Carolina compared to 2012, while Republicans have dropped by about 14,500. In Nevada, Democrats have a smaller early voting deficit today than they did at this point in 2012. And Democrats are slightly ahead in Arizona in the early vote so far, though they are lagging Republicans in the tally of how many Arizonans have requested ballots. 
Perhaps most surprisingly, Democrats improved their position in conservative and Mormon-heavy Utah, where recent polls have shown a tight race. At this point in 2012, Republicans led Democrats in early voting by more than 22,000 voters. But so far this year, the GOP advantage is only 3,509. 
But if you do want Trump to win, the good news is that we still have more than two weeks before November 8th. 
We have seen some extremely bizarre things happen already in this election, and a miracle is definitely not out of the question. 
In fact, I am of the opinion that it is quite likely that some very strange events could take place between now and early November. So hold on to your hats, because the most interesting portion of the 2016 election may still be ahead of us.",1
59,Mindful Eating as Way to Fight Bingeing - The New York Times,Jeff Gordinier,"Editorsโ€ note: Weโ€re resurfacing this 2012 article for Smarter Living. Now sit down, take a deep breath and really savor that Christmas cookie. TRY this: place a forkful of food in your mouth. It doesnโ€t matter what the food is, but make it something you love  โ€”   letโ€s say itโ€s that first nibble from three hot, fragrant, perfectly cooked ravioli. Now comes the hard part. Put the fork down. This could be a lot more challenging than you imagine, because that first bite was very good and another immediately beckons. Youโ€re hungry. Todayโ€s experiment in eating, however, involves becoming aware of that reflexive urge to plow through your meal like Cookie Monster on a shortbread bender. Resist it. Leave the fork on the table. Chew slowly. Stop talking. Tune in to the texture of the pasta, the flavor of the cheese, the bright color of the sauce in the bowl, the aroma of the rising steam. Continue this way throughout the course of a meal, and youโ€ll experience the    pleasures and frustrations of a practice known as mindful eating. The concept has roots in Buddhist teachings. Just as there are forms of meditation that involve sitting, breathing, standing and walking, many Buddhist teachers encourage their students to meditate with food, expanding consciousness by paying close attention to the sensation and purpose of each morsel. In one common exercise, a student is given three raisins, or a tangerine, to spend 10 or 20 minutes gazing at, musing on, holding and patiently masticating. Lately, though, such experiments of the mouth and mind have begun to seep into a secular arena, from the Harvard School of Public Health to the California campus of Google. In the eyes of some experts, what seems like the simplest of acts  โ€”   eating slowly and genuinely relishing each bite  โ€”   could be the remedy for a   Paula Deen Nation in which an endless parade of new diets never seems to slow a stampede toward obesity. Mindful eating is not a diet, or about giving up anything at all. Itโ€s about experiencing food more intensely  โ€”   especially the pleasure of it. You can eat a cheeseburger mindfully, if you wish. You might enjoy it a lot more. Or you might decide, halfway through, that your body has had enough. Or that it really needs some salad. โ€This is โ€ said Dr. Jan Chozen Bays, a pediatrician and meditation teacher in Oregon and the author of โ€Mindful Eating: A Guide to Rediscovering a Healthy and Joyful Relationship with Food. โ€ โ€I think the fundamental problem is that we go unconscious when we eat. โ€ The last few years have brought a spate of books, blogs and videos about   eating. A Harvard nutritionist, Dr. Lilian Cheung, has devoted herself to studying its benefits, and is passionately encouraging corporations and health care providers to try it. At the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University, Prof. Brian Wansink, the author of โ€Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think,โ€ has conducted scores of experiments on the psychological factors that lead to our bottomless bingeing. A mindful lunch hour recently became part of the schedule at Google, and   gurus like Oprah Winfrey and Kathy Freston have become cheerleaders for the practice. With the annual   of Thanksgiving, Christmas and Super Bowl Sunday behind us, and Lent coming, itโ€s worth pondering whether mindful eating is something that the mainstream ought to be, well, more mindful of. Could a discipline pioneered by Buddhist monks and nuns help teach us how to get healthy, relieve stress and shed many of the neuroses that weโ€ve come to associate with food? Dr. Cheung is convinced that it can. Last week, she met with team members at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and asked them to spend quality time with a   almond. โ€The rhythm of life is becoming faster and faster, so we really donโ€t have the same awareness and the same ability to check into ourselves,โ€ said Dr. Cheung, who, with the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh,   โ€Savor: Mindful Eating, Mindful Life. โ€ โ€Thatโ€s why mindful eating is becoming more important. We need to be coming back to ourselves and saying: โ€Does my body need this? Why am I eating this? Is it just because Iโ€m so sad and stressed out?โ€ โ€ The topic has even found its way into culinary circles that tend to be more focused on Rabelaisian excess than monastic restraint. In January, Dr. Michael Finkelstein, a holistic physician who oversees SunRaven, a   center in Bedford, N. Y. gave a talk about mindful gardening and eating at the   headquarters of the James Beard Foundation in New York City. โ€The question isnโ€t what are the foods to eat, in my mind,โ€ he said in an interview. โ€Most people have a general sense of what the healthy foods are, but theyโ€re not eating them. Whatโ€s on your mind when youโ€re eating: thatโ€s mindful eating to me. โ€ A good place to try it is the Blue Cliff Monastery, in Pine Bush, N. Y. a Hudson Valley hamlet. At the serene refuge about 75 miles northwest of Manhattan, curious lay people can join Buddhist brothers and sisters for a free โ€day of mindfulnessโ€ twice a week. At a gathering in January, visitors watched a videotaped lecture by Thich Nhat Hanh (pronounced   ) who founded this and other monasteries around the world they strolled methodically around the grounds as part of a walking meditation, then filed into a dining room for lunch. No one spoke, in keeping with a key principle of mindful eating. The point is simply to eat, as opposed to eating and talking, eating and watching TV, or eating and watching TV and gossiping on the phone while Tweeting and updating oneโ€s Facebook status. A long buffet table of food awaited, all of it vegan and mindfully prepared by two monks in the kitchen. There was plenty of rice, herbed chickpeas, a soup made with cubes of taro, a stew of fried tofu in tomato sauce. In silence, people piled their plates with food, added a squirt or two of condiments (eating mindfully doesnโ€t mean forsaking the hot sauce) and sat down together with eyes closed during a Buddhist prayer for gratitude and moderation. What followed was captivating and mysterious. Surrounded by a murmur of clinking forks, spoons and chopsticks, the Blue Cliff congregation, or sangha, spent the lunch hour contemplating the enjoyment of spice, crunch, saltiness, warmth, tenderness and   company. Some were thinking, too, about the origins of the food: the thousands of farmers, truck drivers and laborers whose work had brought it here. As their jaws moved slowly, their faces took on expressions of deep focus. Every now and then came a pause within the pause: A chime would sound, and, according to the monasteryโ€s custom, all would stop moving and chewing in order to breathe and explore an even deeper level of sensory awareness. It looked peaceful, but inside some of those heads, a struggle was afoot. โ€Itโ€s much more challenging than we would imagine,โ€ said Carolyn Cronin, 64, who lives near the monastery and regularly attends the mindfulness days. โ€People are used to eating so fast. This is a practice of stopping, and we donโ€t realize how much weโ€re not stopping. โ€ For many people, eating fast means eating more. Mindful eating is meant to nudge us beyond what weโ€re craving so that we wake up to why weโ€re craving it and what factors might be stoking the habit of  . โ€As we practice this regularly, we become aware that we donโ€t need to eat as much,โ€ said Phap Khoi, 43, a robed monk who has been stationed at Blue Cliff since it opened in 2007. โ€Whereas when people just gulp down food, they can eat a lot and not feel full. โ€ Itโ€s this byproduct of mindful eating  โ€”   its potential as a psychological barrier to overeating  โ€”   that has generated excitement among nutritionists like Dr. Cheung. โ€Thich Nhat Hanh often talks about our craving being like a crying baby who is trying to draw our attention,โ€ she said. โ€When the baby cries, the mother cradles the baby to try to calm the baby right away. By acknowledging and embracing our cravings through a few breaths, we can stop our autopilot of reaching out to the pint of ice cream or the bag of chips. โ€ The average American doesnโ€t have the luxury of ruminating on the intense tang of sriracha sauce at a monastery. โ€Most of us are not going to be Buddhist monks,โ€ said Dr. Finkelstein, the holistic physician. โ€What Iโ€ve learned is that it has to work at home. โ€ To that end, he and others suggest that people start with a few baby steps. โ€Donโ€t be too hard on yourself,โ€ Dr. Cheung said. โ€Youโ€re not supposed to be able to switch on your mindfulness button and be able to do it 100 percent. Itโ€s a practice you keep working toward. โ€ Dr. Bays, the pediatrician, has recommendations that can sound like a return to the simple rhythms of Mayberry, if not โ€Little House on the Prairie. โ€ If itโ€s impossible to eat mindfully every day, consider planning one special repast a week. Click off the TV. Sit at the table with loved ones. โ€How about the first five minutes we eat, we just eat in silence and really enjoy our food?โ€ she said. โ€It happens step by step. โ€ Sometimes, even she is too busy to contemplate a chickpea. So there are days when Dr. Bays will take three mindful sips of tea, โ€and then, O. K. Iโ€ve got to go do my work,โ€ she said. โ€Anybody can do that. Anywhere. โ€ Even scarfing down a burrito in the car offers an opportunity for insight. โ€Mindful eating includes mindless eating,โ€ she said. โ€ โ€I am aware that I am eating and driving.โ€ โ€ Few places in America are as frantically abuzz with activity as the Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. but when Thich Nhat Hanh dropped by for a day of mindfulness in September, hundreds of employees showed up. Part of the event was devoted to eating thoughtfully in silence, and the practice was so well received that an hourlong wordless vegan lunch is now a monthly observance on the Google campus. โ€Interestingly enough, a lot of the participants are the engineers, which pleases us very much,โ€ said Olivia Wu, an executive chef at the company. โ€I think it quiets the mind. I think there is a real sense of feeling restored so that they can go back to the crazy pace that they came from. โ€ Itโ€s not often, after all, that those workhorse technicians get to stop and smell the pesto. โ€Somebody will say, โ€I ate so much less,โ€ โ€ Ms. Wu said. โ€And someone else will say, โ€You know, I never noticed how spicy arugula tastes.โ€ โ€ And that could be the ingredient that helps mindful eating gain traction in mainstream American culture: flavor. โ€So many people now have found themselves in an adversarial relationship with food, which is very tragic,โ€ Dr. Bays said. โ€Eating should be a pleasurable activity. โ€",0
60,The Major Potential Impact of a Corporate Tax Overhaul - The New York Times,Neil Irwin,"The United States system for taxing businesses is a mess. If thereโ€s one thing nearly everyone can agree upon, it is that. The current corporate income tax manages the weird trick of both taxing companies at a higher statutory rate than other advanced countries while collecting less money, as a percentage of the overall economy, than most of them. It is infinitely complicated and it gives companies incentives to borrow too much money and move operations to countries with lower tax rates. Now, the moment for trying to fix all of that appears to have arrived. With the House, Senate and presidency all soon to be in Republican hands and with all agreeing that a major tax bill is a top priority, some kind of change appears likely to happen. And it may turn out to be a very big deal, particularly if a tax plan that House Republicans proposed last summer becomes the core of new legislation. Among Washingtonโ€s lobbying shops and policy analysis crowd, itโ€s known as a โ€  cash flow tax with border adjustment. โ€ Itโ€s easier to think of it as the most substantial reworking of how businesses are taxed since the corporate income tax was introduced a century ago. And it could, if enacted, have big effects not just in the tax departments of major corporations but in global financial markets and the aisles of your local Walmart. This possible revamping of the corporate tax code is less politically polarizing than the debates sure to unfold in the months ahead over health care, or even over individual income taxes. But the consequences for business  โ€”   and for the   trajectory of the economy  โ€”   are huge. The basic idea behind a D. B. C. F. T. (to use the abbreviation that has taken hold in a particularly nerdy corner of Twitter) is this: Right now companies are taxed based on their income generated in the United States. But there are countless tricks that corporate accountants can play to reduce the income companies report and to reduce their tax burden, and those tricks distort the economy. Two prime examples are transferring intellectual property to overseas holding companies and engaging in corporate inversions that move a companyโ€s legal headquarters to a country with lower taxes. Moreover, because interest payments on debt are   the current system makes it appealing to take on as much debt as possible, even though that can increase the risk of bankruptcy when a downturn comes along. The House Republicansโ€ approach, instead of taxing the    corporate income, goes after a firmโ€s domestic cash flow: money that comes in from sales within the United States borders minus money that goes out to pay employees and buy supplies and so forth. Thereโ€s no incentive to play games with overseas companies that exist only to exploit tax differences or to relocate production to countries with lower taxes because youโ€ll be taxed on things you sell in the United States, regardless. โ€With an income tax, one of the key issues is โ€how do you measure income,โ€ โ€ said Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a leading advocate of the idea. โ€But with cash flow you just follow the money. โ€ And the tax, Mr. Auerbach argues, could spur business investment while not encouraging companies to rely on debt. It allows companies to enjoy the tax savings of capital investments immediately rather than depreciating them over time. And it doesnโ€t give favorable treatment to debt, as opposed to equity. That alone would amount to a major shift in the tax system. Congressional staff members, the incoming administration and armies of lobbyists will spend countless hours hammering out the details of any such proposal: how it might be phased in, and how to treat financial services, and much more. Some of the most complex, and politically problematic, elements of the plan revolve around its treatment of international trade, which creates winners and losers. And some of those potential losers are powerful. Consider what border adjustment means: When an American company exports goods under this new tax system, it would not pay any taxes on its international sales, while its imports would be taxed. So a company that spent $80 making something that it sold overseas for $100 would pay no tax on its earnings. A company that imported goods worth $80 from abroad and them sold them domestically for $100 would pay tax on the full $100. At first glance this looks as if it would boost exports and reduce the trade deficit. Indeed, it might prove politically promising for advocates of the strategy to pitch the plan as one that would do this. Many economists think it wonโ€t work that way, however. Thatโ€s because as soon as a    tax with border adjustment looks likely to become law, the value of the dollar should rise in currency markets. And that stronger dollar could eliminate the apparent     effects of the tax. The dollar could rise by, say, 20 to 25 percent, and the trade balance could remain about where it started. Essentially, moving to this system means betting on a โ€textbook economic theory,โ€ as analysts at Evercore ISI put it, becoming a reality even though the effect hasnโ€t been tested in practice. If the dollar doesnโ€t strengthen as expected, for example,   industries, especially those with lean profit margins, could face disaster. That helps explain why some of the stiffest opposition to this tax overhaul is coming from the retail industry. Essentially, economists are telling them โ€trust us, our models say the currency will adjust and it will all come out in the wash,โ€ but if the models are wrong, for companies like Walmart, Target and many others that sell large volumes of imported goods, their viability could be threatened. If the models turn out to be right, there is a different set of risks. The United States dollar is the linchpin of the global financial system, and a large move in its value triggered by changes in domestic tax policy could have unforeseen effects. Many companies worldwide, especially banks and especially in emerging markets, have debt denominated in dollars, which would become more of a burden after a new dollar appreciation. A big dollar rise would also effectively shift trillions in wealth from American investments overseas toward global investors with assets in the United States. As Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has noted, we donโ€t really know what the distributional consequences of this tax overhaul would be. It could increase the costs of imported goods that the poor spend a disproportionate portion of their income on, like clothing and gasoline. That would be bad news for poorer Americans even as it makes the overall economy more efficient. Thereโ€s still a lot of work to be done to understand the   consequences of the D. B. C. F. T. (also, work to be done to find a catchier name). But thereโ€s a broader point about the nature of any major policy reform. The benefits of a reworked corporate tax code would emerge slowly these disruptions and costs could arrive almost instantly. No matter the outcome, 2017 will be a fascinating year in which core components of the tax system  โ€”   with   economic consequences  โ€”   will be up for grabs.",0

62,3 Makers of Worldโ€s Smallest Machines Awarded Nobel Prize in Chemistry - The New York Times,Kenneth Chang and Sewell Chan,"Three pioneers in the development of nanomachines, made of moving molecules, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry on Wednesday. Molecular machines, the worldโ€s smallest mechanical devices, may eventually be used to create new materials, sensors and energy storage systems, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the prize. โ€In terms of development, the molecular motor is at the same stage as the electric motor was in the 1830s, when scientists displayed various spinning cranks and wheels, unaware that they would lead to electric trains, washing machines, fans and food processors,โ€ the academy said. The three scientists  โ€”     Sauvage, J. Fraser Stoddart and Bernard L. Feringa  โ€”   will share equally in the prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $930, 000. Nanotechnology  โ€”   the creation of structures on the scale of a nanometer, or a billionth of a meter  โ€”   has been a field of fruitful research for a couple of decades. Now, scientists are learning how to construct tiny moving machines about   the width of a strand of human hair. โ€Theyโ€ve got it started,โ€ said Donna J. Nelson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Oklahoma and president of the American Chemical Society. โ€This is just the beginning. โ€ The first step toward creating a molecular machine was making a moving part. Chemists have long been able to synthesize   molecules, and they knew that interlocking rings might function as molecular parts. But how to create a second ring that passed through the first ring? Dr. Sauvage figured that out in 1983. A charged copper ion essentially acted as a pin around which to form the interlocking rings, he found. Once the rings were connected, the copper ion could be removed. These molecules became known as catenanes. The pieces of the molecule were held together mechanically, like links in a chain, rather than the usual chemical bonds. Dr. Stoddart made the next advance in 1991. Instead of two interlocking rings, Dr. Stoddart, then at the University of Birmingham in Britain, and his colleagues synthesized a rotaxane: a ring molecule wrapped around a   axle. The ring slides back and forth along the dumbbell, like a bead on an abacus. Dr. Stoddart went on to construct a small computer chip that was essentially a molecular abacus, as well as other complex devices. One was composed of three rotaxanes whose rings were connected to form a larger platform that could rise 0. 7 billionths of a meter: a molecular elevator. Rotaxanes bending thin layers of gold acted like an artificial muscle, he found. As a sidelight, Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Stoddart used their techniques to create molecules that twisted in complicated knots. Dr. Stoddart said in an interview that he was inspired by the interlocking forms in Celtic art. Dr. Feringa, in 1999, became the first person to develop a molecular motor, creating a minuscule rotor blade powered by light that spun continually in the same direction. The first motor was not fast, but 15 years later, he and his research group demonstrated one that spun 12 million times per second. In 2011, they built a    molecular โ€car. โ€ Four of the molecular motors acted as wheels, connected by a  . The three men invigorated the field of topological chemistry, the academy said on Wednesday. They were pioneers in the second wave of nanotechnology, a field that the physicist Richard P. Feynman, also a Nobel laureate, foresaw as early as 1959. He gave a seminal lecture in 1984, toward the end of his life, on design and engineering at the molecular scale. In living organisms, nature has produced a slew of molecular machines that ferry materials around cells, construct proteins and divide cells. Artificial molecular machines are still primitive by comparison, but scientists can already envision applications in the future. โ€Think about nanomachines, microrobots,โ€ said Dr. Feringa, who spoke by telephone with journalists assembled in Stockholm at the prize announcement. โ€Think about tiny robots that the doctor in the future will inject in your blood veins, and they go search for cancer cells or going to deliver drugs, for instance. โ€ The technology could also lead to the creation of โ€smart materialsโ€ that change properties based on external signals, Dr. Feringa said. Dr. Sauvage, 71, was born in Paris and received his Ph. D. in 1971 from the University of Strasbourg in France, where he is a professor emeritus. He is also director of research emeritus at the National Center for Scientific Research in France. Dr. Stoddart, 74, was born in Edinburgh, received his Ph. D. in 1966 from Edinburgh University, and is a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He previously taught at U. C. L. A. and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his services to science. Dr. Feringa, 64, was born in   the Netherlands, and received his Ph. D. in 1978 from the University of Groningen, where he is a professor of organic chemistry. Dr. Feringa said he was โ€a bit shockedโ€ when he got the phone call telling him he had received the Nobel. โ€I feel a little bit like the Wright brothers, who were flying 100 years ago for the first time,โ€ he said. โ€People were saying, โ€Why do we need a flying machine?โ€ And now we have a Boeing 747 and an Airbus. โ€ The molecular discovery โ€opens up a whole new world of nanomachines,โ€ he said, while acknowledging that, as scientists figure out how to make machines that can operate autonomously, โ€we have to think about how we can handle these things safely. โ€ Dr. Stoddartโ€s name had been mentioned for the Nobel for years. โ€It really got to the point where I didnโ€t take it very seriously,โ€ he said. He was asleep when the phone rang at 4 a. m. โ€I detected a Swedish accent, and I thought it was probably not a prank,โ€ Dr. Stoddart said. When told that he was sharing the prize with Dr. Sauvage and Dr. Feringa, โ€I was totally delighted, because these are my scientific brothers in many ways,โ€ he said. James M. Tour, a professor of chemistry at Rice University in Houston, said the Nobel would bestow legitimacy on the field and help convince people that nanomachines are not just fantastical science fiction of the far future. โ€No one is making money on these right now, but it will come,โ€ he said. โ€These men have established and built up the field in a remarkable way. โ€ Dr. Tour predicted that the first profitable use of the technology might be machines that open up cell membranes in the body to deliver drugs. โ€Itโ€s really going to be quite extraordinary,โ€ he said. โ–  Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for โ€ . โ€ โ–  David J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz shared the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for their research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states. Tomas Lindahl, Paul L. Modrich and Aziz Sancar were awarded the prize last year for discovering how cells repair their DNA and protect it from the sunโ€s ultraviolet light, as well as from natural toxins and industrial pollutants. Three more will be awarded in the coming days. The Nobel Peace Prize will be announced on Friday in Norway. The Memorial Prize in Economic Science will come on Monday, Oct. 10, in Sweden.

64,"Review: โ€Lionโ€ Brings Tears for a Lost Boy, Wiped Dry by Google - The New York Times",A. O. Scott,"The first part of โ€Lion,โ€ Garth Davisโ€s unabashedly   movie about a remarkable   incident, has some of the scary, wondrous feeling of a fairy tale. The audience is invited to imagine a   time  โ€”   1986, to be precise  โ€”   before social media or smartphones or Google. In those days, a person could get lost, which is just what happens to a little boy named Saroo (Sunny Pawar) who accidentally travels more than 1, 000 miles from his home in central India to the streets of Calcutta. Sarooโ€s mother (Priyanka Bose) is a laborer in a poor village. He and his beloved older brother, Guddu (Abhishek Bharate) supplement her meager wages with whatever casual work they can find. In the first scene, they are scavenging lumps of coal to exchange for milk at the market. Later, Saroo follows Guddu to a railroad station, where the younger boy accidentally boards an    train that takes him to a city full of strangers who speak a different language. With minimal dialogue and graceful editing, Mr. Davis and the screenwriter Luke Davies convey the Dickensian dimensions of Sarooโ€s situation. He is small and vulnerable, but also smart and resourceful, and even as he is exposed to horrifying cruelty, he is also a hero on an adventure. The enormous pain of his loss is sometimes mitigated by the excitement of discovery. You fear for him, and also root for him, and mostly you are captivated by his story and the sophisticated simplicity of its telling. What happens in the second part of the movie is a little more complicated. Saroo (now played by Dev Patel) has grown to manhood as the adopted son of an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). He has a brother, Mantosh (Divian Ladwa) who was also adopted from India and has mental health and   problems. Despite that, Saroo seems to be living in the    stage of the fairy tale. He moves to Melbourne to study hotel management and falls in love with a fellow student, Lucy (Rooney Mara) from America. But memories of his   life haunt him, and the arrival of new technology raises the tantalizing possibility of a return to his first home. Using Google Earth, Saroo sets out to retrace, on the computer screen and on sheets of paper tacked to his bedroom wall, his accidental journey. Itโ€s not a fast or easy process, and the effort takes an emotional toll on him, on his parents and on Lucy. But you know, even if youโ€re not familiar with the true story behind โ€Lion,โ€ that the fairy tale will come true. Mr. Davis, with strong assistance from a cast of dignified, charismatic criers and the music of Hauschka and Dustin Oโ€Halloran, floods the viewer with big feelings. If you have ever been a child, raised a child, lost a child or met a child  โ€”   or a mother  โ€”   this movie will wreck you. As a purely emotional experience it succeeds without feeling too manipulative or maudlin. I mean, it is manipulative and maudlin, but in a way that seems fair and transparent. Still, it isnโ€t quite satisfying. The transition from the young to the   Saroo demands a shift in tone and genre that โ€Lionโ€ doesnโ€t quite achieve. What felt in the first part like wonderful, Spielbergian simplicity feels, in the latter sections, like simplification. There isnโ€t enough of the rough texture of family life or the complications of young love to give the older Saroo a full identity. The movie hovers on the edge of going deeper into his psychological predicament but holds itself back. At the end, the focus shifts from the agonies of Saroo to the glories of Google. I canโ€t complain too much about that for all I know, Google brought you to this review. But I also canโ€t help feeling a dystopian chill amid all the warm donโ€   fuzzies, a hint of corporate propaganda behind the fable. It is indeed remarkable how small the world has become, how many problems data can solve, how connected we all are to one another. But weโ€ve lost something, too, and we canโ€t even see what it is. โ€Lionโ€ is rated   (Parents strongly cautioned) for sex and profanity. Running time: 1 hour 59 minutes.",0
65,U.S. General: Islamic State Chemical Attack Had โ€No Impactโ€ on U.S. Forces,Kristina Wong,"WASHINGTON  โ€”   U. S. and Australian troops advising Iraqi forces got caught up in a chemical weapons attack by the Islamic State (ISIS) in western Mosul during the weekend, a U. S. general confirmed Wednesday. [The chemical agent did not affect U. S. forces and is still undergoing testing, said Maj. Gen. Joseph Martin, the commander of U. S. and coalition ground forces in Iraq.  โ€Daesh has used chemicals in the vicinity of Mosul. The chemicals have had no impact on the Iraqi Security Forces. They had no impact on our forces,โ€ Martin said, using a derogatory Arabic acronym for ISIS. A U. S. defense official said U. S. forces donned protective gear. Australian troops were not exposed to the substance, according to an article by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Australian medics provided some Iraqi forces first aid after the attack. A U. S. defense official said those Iraqi forces have returned to duty. It is not the first time ISIS has used chemical weapons in Iraq. The U. S.  military coalition confirmed in 2015 the first instances of the terrorist group using sulfur mustard and mustard gas. An assessment by IHS Conflict Monitor found in November 2015 that ISIS has used chemicals, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times in Iraq and Syria since 2014. Martin said the chemicals ISIS has used in the past are all โ€ โ€ because of the groupโ€s lack of production capability. He said the chemicals were believed to have been delivered by indirect fire, meaning via rocket or some projectile containing the chemical agent. Martin said U. S. forces have the appropriate equipment and training to protect themselves from chemical weapons. The attack also raised the question of how closely U. S. forces are operating with Iraqi forces. Officials have said U. S. troops are not on the front lines fighting ISIS. However, Martin indicated they are close together and share the same risks. Martin said U. S. forces are with Iraqi security forces at โ€various command and control locations throughout Iraq. โ€ โ€Being forward with those command and control facilities, they share the same risks the Iraqis do,โ€ he said. He added that U. S. forces are โ€forward with the Iraqis each and every day. โ€ A defense official of unknown nationality told ABC that Australian and U. S. advisers were with Iraqi forces at the time of the attack. Martin characterized ISIS as getting increasingly desperate, as Iraqi forces  โ€”   backed by the U. S.  military coalition  โ€”   are succeeding in pushing the terrorist group out of their main stronghold in Iraq. Martin said ISIS members were turning on civilians, killing hundreds each week. โ€As I see it, the longer this fight goes on in west Mosul, the civilians will suffer at the hands of a brutal enemy. This is why ISIS must be defeated quickly,โ€ he said. He said ISIS was using civilians as human shields and fighting from protected sites. โ€ISIS uses the tactic of taking civilians hostage for protection while theyโ€re fighting from protected sites. ISIS has been indiscriminate in their use of [  improvised explosive devices] and building IEDs to kill, maim and injure innocent civilians as part of their ongoing campaign of terror,โ€ he said. Martin said ISISโ€s โ€leadership has fled and their days are numbered. โ€ Meanwhile, he said, Iraqi forces were getting better. โ€They continue to improve their capability and demonstrate a level of professionalism that makes me proud to serve with them. Itโ€s only a matter of time before they liberate the rest of Mosul and defeat ISIS in Iraq,โ€ he said.",0
66,"Jury finds all Oregon standoff defendants not guilty of federal conspiracy, gun charges",Admin,"Oregon Live โ€“ by Maxine Bernstein 
A federal jury on Thursday found Ammon Bundy, his brother Ryan Bundy and five co-defendants not guilty of conspiring to prevent federal employees from doing their jobs through intimidation, threat or force during the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. 
The Bundy brothers and occupiers Jeff Banta and David Fry also were found not guilty of having guns in a federal facility. Kenneth Medenbach was found not guilty of stealing government property, and a hung jury was declared on Ryan Bundyโ€s charge of theft of FBI surveillance cameras. 
โ€More than we could have hoped for,โ€ said one of Ammon Bundyโ€s lawyers, J. Morgan Philpot. 
โ€Stunning,โ€ said defense lawyer Lisa Ludwig, who was standby counsel for Ryan Bundy. 
โ€Iโ€m just thrilled,โ€ said Neil Wamplerโ€s attorney Lisa Maxfield. 
The jury of nine women and three men returned the verdicts after five hours of deliberations on Thursday in the high-profile case that riveted the state and drew national and international attention to the federal bird sanctuary in rural eastern Oregon. 
Each defendant stood separately, facing the jury, as the judge read the verdicts. Ammon Bundy, his hands clasped behind his back, nodded as the โ€not guiltyโ€ verdicts were read for him first. As he sat, he smiled and rubbed the shoulder of his lawyer, Marcus Mumford. 
His older brother Ryan Bundy stood. As his โ€not guiltyโ€ verdicts were read, he nodded, and mouthed to the jury, โ€Thank you.โ€ Defendant Neil Wampler hugged and kissed his defense lawyer, Maxfield. 
The coda to the stunning verdict, undoubtedly a significant blow to federal prosecutors, was when Ammon Bundyโ€s lawyer Marcus Mumford argued that his client, dressed in a gray suit and white dress shirt, should be allowed to walk out of the court, a free man. 
U.S. District Judge Anna J. Brown told him that there was a U.S. Marshalโ€s hold on him from a pending federal indictment in Nevada. 
Oregon Standoff defendant Jeff Banta is relieved by acquittals 
โ€If thereโ€s a detainer, show me,โ€ Mumford stood, arguing before the judge. 
Suddenly, a group of about six U.S. Marshals surrounded Mumford at his defense table. The judge directed them to move back but moments later, the marshals grabbed on to him. 
โ€What are you doing?โ€ Mumford yelled, as he struggled and was taken down to the floor. 
As deputy marshals yelled, โ€Stop resisting,โ€ the judge demanded, โ€Everybody out of the courtroom now!โ€ 
Mumford was taken into custody, a member of his legal team confirmed. 
Ammon Bundyโ€s lawyer J. Morgan Philpot, said afterwards on the courthouse steps that Mumford had been arrested and marshals had used a stun gun, or Taser, on his back. Another member of Ammon Bundyโ€s legal team Rick Koerber, echoed Philpot, saying he heard Mumford questioning in court why they were using a Taser against him. 
Philpot decried the marshalsโ€ treatment of Mumford in the courtroom. โ€What happened at the end is symbolic of the improper use of force by the federal government,โ€ he said. 
By 6:30 p.m., Mumford was released from custody. He confirmed that he was struck with a stun gun once while he was on the floor of the courtroom. 
โ€I grew up on a dairy farm, so am I used to some rough treatment, sure?โ€ he said. But he said the actions of the U.S. marshals were uncalled for. 
โ€All I was asking for was papers. Just show me you have the authority to take Mr. Bundy into custody.โ€ 
As to the verdict, โ€Very pleased, very gratified. This jury was dedicated. They listened to our case.โ€ 
Just after the verdicts were announced, people emerged onto the front steps of the courthouse to tell a crowd of media and onlookers. 
Supporters of the defendants gathered in a joyous hug. One of them, Brand Thornton of Las Vegas, one of the original occupiers who accompanied Ryan Bundy and others onto the refuge on Jan. 2 and was called as witness by the defense, said that he has been at the trial since Oct. 2. 
The verdict โ€means everything,โ€ Thornton said. Itโ€s huge for ranchers and land rights within Harney County and across the West, he said. 
โ€We did something peaceful and wanted to stay peaceful,โ€ said Thornton, who has kept vigil outside the courthouse, blowing a shofar. 
โ€This is for the people of Oregon,โ€ Thornton said. โ€This was never for us.โ€ 
Wampler appeared on the courthouse steps and described the verdict as a โ€stunning victory for rural America.โ€ 
David Fryโ€s lawyer Per C. Olson said, โ€It was the right result.โ€ 
โ€I think the jury saw through this that they were well-meaning, well-intentioned individuals,โ€ Olson said. The jury saw that the defendants cared about the Hammonds and didnโ€t like how the federal government was treating them. 
Maxfield, who represented Wampler, came out of the courthouse, holding up her fists. She said she has never seen โ€anything like this happen,โ€ where multiple defendants in a federal court trial were all acquitted, and called it one of the most significant cases in her career. 
Defendant Shawna Cox said she had a โ€peaceful feeling,โ€ as she waited for the verdicts, โ€but I didnโ€t expect weโ€d all be found not guilty.โ€ 
โ€I wept,โ€ Cox said. โ€It brings me to tears. Iโ€m so grateful to the jury.โ€ 
Defense lawyer Matthew Schindler, standby counsel to defendant Kenneth Medenbach who was excused from court because of medical ailments, said he called his client right away. 
โ€Heโ€s been fighting for more than 20 years to be in a situation where a jury acquitted him,โ€ Schindler said. โ€Itโ€s vindication.โ€ 
Schindler said he believes the juryโ€s verdicts resulted from the difficulty the government had in proving that the โ€intentโ€ of the defendants was to conspire against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Bureau of Land Management. 
โ€The judge gave us broad ability to bring in a defendantโ€s state of mind and what you saw was a number of defendants who each had their own motivations,โ€ Schindler said. 
When prosecuting a drug conspiracy, itโ€s easy to point to what the defendantsโ€ underlying objective is. But in this case, Schindler said, there was โ€no obvious underlying self interest.โ€ He said the defense also was bolstered because the jurors came from different regions from the state, and not just from Portland. 
Oregon U.S. Attorney Billy Williams sat in the back of the courtroom with Oregonโ€s FBI Special Agent in Charge Gregg Bretzing as the verdicts were read. Williams left the courtroom early, before the scrum with Mumford, to attend a gathering of the League of Minority Voters in Salem Thursday night. 
Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward, who was the face of law enforcement during the 41-day refuge takeover, said in a statement, โ€While I am disappointed in the outcome, I believe our form of government and justice system to be the best in the world. These folks were tried in a court of law and found not guilty by a jury of their peers. This is our system, and I stand by it.โ€ 
The five-week trial offered a rare display: Three of the seven defendants chose to represent themselves. Five of them were among the more than 80 people who took the witness stand to testify. 
And one of the original 12 jurors was dismissed after a fellow juror raised concerns about his impartiality four days into an initial round of deliberations โ€“ what the judge called an โ€extraordinary circumstance.โ€ An alternate juror was summoned to begin a new round of deliberations with the remaining 11 jurors Thursday morning. 
There was heightened security in and around the courthouse throughout the trial, with security officers ordered to wear bulletproof vests, and metal detectors set up outside the main trial courtroom and an overflow room with a live video feed of the proceedings. 
Often, supporters knelt in prayer in the courthouse corridor before the trial began in the mornings, and some kept vigil across the street, with one fellow occupier blowing a ramโ€s horn, or shofar, as the jury deliberated. 
PENDING PROSECUTIONS 
The seven on trial were among 26 people indicted on the conspiracy charge. 
Eleven of them pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge. 
Seven others are set for trial on Feb. 14, but their cases may be affected by the verdicts. If convictions are handed down in this case, then defendants scheduled for trial in February might consider potential pleas. If there are acquittals, prosecutors may rethink going to trial on same charges against co-defendants next year. 
On the eve of jury selection in this case, prosecutors agreed to dismiss the conspiracy charge against Pete Santilli, an independent broadcaster and self-described โ€shock jock,โ€ who provided live stream footage of the occupation. 
NEVADA CASE 
Ammon Bundy and Ryan Bundy also face prosecution in Nevada in the 2014 standoff with federal agents over the impounding of their fatherโ€s cattle near Bunkerville, Nevada. 
The trial there is set to start Feb. 6. The two brothers and father Cliven Bundy are among 19 indicted in Nevada. Others from the Oregon refuge occupation also indicted on federal charges in Nevada are Pete Santilli, Ryan Payne, Brian Cavalier, Blaine Cooper and Joseph Oโ€Shaughnessy. 
Payne pleaded guilty to the federal conspiracy charge in Oregon under a potential global agreement that was in the works with Nevada prosecutors, but he recently asked to withdraw the Oregon plea because no deal was reached in Nevada. Prosecutors in Portland have until Oct. 31 to respond. 
Cooper entered guilty pleas in both cases. Oโ€Shaughnessy pleaded guilty in the Oregon case, with a deal pending in Nevada. Cavalier pleaded guilty in the Oregon case.

A SHOCKING blow to the Clinton Campaign emerged unexpectedly Friday as the FBI has reportedly REOPENED probe into Hillary Clintonโ€s email server as โ€The FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.โ€

Yes. Exactly! 
Heโ€ll own it once we vote him in there. 
Then heโ€ll pull the plug and drain it and put all those corrupt SOBs in prison. Maybe you too ; )

This monster needs to be opened, all right. 
Iโ€ll leave up to the readers to come up with ways to execute that idea. 
How many people were there when Nixon was reelected despite the fact that the Watergate investigation was in full swing? That ended pretty badly for Tricky Dick. And Killer was on the judicial investigation group at this time. This group was lead by a Democrat and he fired Killer for lying. I donโ€t recall the nature of the lie but it was enough to get her fired. 
From Fox News Politics 

FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter to top members of Congress Friday that the bureau has โ€learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.โ€ 
Comey did not detail those emails, saying only that they surfaced โ€in connection with an unrelated case.โ€ 
He told lawmakers the investigative team briefed him on the information a day earlier, โ€and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.โ€ 
He said the FBI could not yet assess whether the new material is significant and he could not predict how long it will take to complete โ€this additional work.โ€",1
68,Pence Will Speak at Anti-Abortion Rally - The New York Times,Jeremy W. Peters,"WASHINGTON  โ€”   Vice President Mike Pence will speak on Friday to a gathering of   activists on the National Mall, a sign of the movementโ€s new and growing authority in a government now dominated by Republicans. The organizers for the event, the March for Life, had extended invitations to President Trump and Mr. Pence. A senior White House official confirmed that Mr. Pence would address the marchers. Mr. Penceโ€s appearance will come just a few days before Mr. Trump is expected to reveal his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the death of Justice  Antonin Scalia  last year. Mr. Trump has said his pick, like Mr. Scalia, would oppose abortion rights, one of several promises he has made to roll back legal protections for the procedure. Other Republican presidents, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush, have spoken to the march, but remotely.   leaders see the Trump administrationโ€s commitment to their cause and the looming Supreme Court nomination battle as a tipping point after eight years of a Democratic administration. The symbolism of hearing from Mr. Pence and another senior Trump administration official, Kellyanne Conway, at the march is hard to overlook. Mr. Trump eventually won over many reluctant   leaders who had chafed at his past support for abortion rights and his history of being a    role model for religious conservatives. Mr. Trumpโ€s pledges to them, which he made in writing before the election, have gone a long way to rebuilding trust.   activists say they are among the most detailed and serious pledges a president has made to their cause. They include a vow to sign a nationwide ban on abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy and a commitment to ensuring that his Supreme Court appointments are against the procedure.",0
69,Bernie Sanders Says What The Media Wonโ€t: Trump Is A Gutless Political Coward,Jason Easley,"โ€” Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 27, 2016 If you donโ€t have the guts to run for office on your ideas @realDonaldTrump , then you shouldnโ€t run for office at all. 
โ€” Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) October 27, 2016 
Sen. Sanders was correct. Elections are supposed to be contests about ideas and visions for the future. However, the Republican Party ran out of ideas decades ago and has been on a slow and steady descent into substituting beliefs for facts, and hopes for visions. 
Trump is trying to suppress the vote because voter suppression is the only tactic that he has left that may lead him to victory. 
It takes guts and courage to run a presidential campaign based on ideas and principles. Donald Trump lacking in both the guts and courage departments which is why he is spending the final days of his presidential campaign trying to con and scheme his way into the Oval Office. 
The media will never say it, but real candidates for office donโ€t try to win by discouraging people from voting. The best candidates get people excited to vote and play their vital role in the democratic process. 
Bernie Sanders gets it. Donald Trump never will.",1
70,How To Make Briquettes From Daily Waste,Chris Black,"  22, 2016 How To Make Briquettes From Daily Waste 
Do you remember that old saying that one manโ€s garbage is another manโ€s treasure? The same principle applies to our daily wastes. 
In case you did not know it, Americans are among the most wasteful civilization in history. Actually, I would dare to say that we are the champions, my friends, and thatโ€s nothing to be proud of. 
We waste at an incredible rate: absolutely anything, including food, where we lead the world by a wide margin. Also, as a nation, the United States generates more municipal solid-waste per person/per day than any other developed/industrial country in the world, boasting 7.1 pounds of solid waste a day, per person. 
If you crunch these numbersโ€“ 365 days a year x 330 million people x 7.1 pounds of solid waste โ€“ youโ€ll come up with astonishing numbers. 
Putting Waste to Work for Energy 
It was a Greek philosopher who once said 2000 years ago that nothing gets wasted โ€“ everything gets transformed, or something along these lines. To follow this guyโ€s axiom, we can transform waste into an excellent and basically perpetual source of energy . 
We, the preppers, can help mitigate the โ€disasterโ€ and put that amount of waste to good use, by making briquettes using daily wastes. 
Briquettes are traditionally defined as compressed blocks of combustible material โ€“ usually coal dust, wood chips, paper, peat or sawdust โ€“ that are used to start a fire. The terms derives from the French language and it means โ€brick.โ€ 
Biomass briquettes are starting to become all the rage nowadays and daily waste is basically biomass. Traditionally, biomass briquettes are built from agricultural waste and theyโ€re used as a โ€greenโ€ replacement for hydrocarbons (coal, oil etc) in all sorts of applications, including industrial stuff like heating boilers and whatnot. 
Currently, almost half of the worldโ€s population is using charcoal and/or wood for heating and cooking purposes. 
Cutting the forest for subsistence farming or for cooking your food or heating your home is not a great idea if you have better alternatives, and thatโ€s the whole purpose of technology: making the world a better place and improving   humans, right? 
Any household can reduce their need for charcoal and wood by creating their own fuel so to speak, by making โ€fuel briquettesโ€ using waste plant material which is readily available in their own environment. 
How to Make the Briquettes 
So, what type of wastes can be re-used for making fuel briquettes? Paper Charcoal fines Any other type of agricultural waste. 
Itโ€s important to realize that not all waste is created equal, and this is where the calorific value of each type of waste comes into play. 
As a general rule of thumb, the aforementioned materials are the best when it comes to DIY fuel briquettes (sawdust, paper etc), but youโ€ll have to use a home-made press for achieving legendary status, i.e becoming energy self-sufficient as much as humanly possible. 
There are also commercially available presses. Youโ€ll just have to look for them on the internet or in   
The fuel briquettes are being made around the world using mini Bryant and Peterson presses. You can also make them by hand or using a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . 
You can also use a plastic mold. Video first seen on The Do It Yourself World . 
Basically, you can use a plastic bottle or any other type of plastic container in order to shape the briquette. Youโ€ll also need something that you can use as a piston that fits into the respective container to press it, in order to get the water out of the mix. You can use something like a tin can or a piece of wood as the piston along with a plastic bag, a knife and some wire. 
Hereโ€s a cool idea about DIY-ing a mold-press biomass fuel briquette using an old DVD container. The possibilities are basically endless. 
Video first seen on nobodyprepper . 
How to Make Briquettes in Easy Steps 
Step 1 โ€“ preparing the briquette mix 
For example, if youโ€re going to use waste paper and sawdust (the simplest to DIY and very efficient and cost effective), youโ€ll have to soak the paper in water for a couple of days in order to soften it and to allow the fibers to be released, as these fibers will later bind the materials together. 
In the next step, youโ€ll have to thoroughly homogenize the soaked paper using your hands until the stuff reaches the consistency of porridge or mashed potatoes, i.e. no pieces are evident in the โ€soupโ€. This step is very important but it takes some time and youโ€ll have to do it well. 
To speed up the process, you can use tools such as a mortar and pestle or a dedicated pounding tool for processing the paper mix quickly and more efficiently. 
The simplest mix for homemade briquettes consists of one part soaked paper and 3/4 parts sawdust. You can also add pine needles, rice husks, chopped leaves/grass, charcoal fines and any other flammable materials you can think of into the mix, as theyโ€ll add to the flavor. Youโ€ll have to use roughly 20% paper though โ€“ thatโ€s the lesson to be taken home. 
You can alternatively swap paper for cassava peels/flour, which can replace the paperโ€s binding properties into the sawdust-mix. Youโ€ll have to boil the cassava until it gets very soft, but in sufficient amounts, the cassava paste will successfully replace the paper for the purpose of binding the sawdust together. 
In the next step, youโ€ll have to mix the paper or cassava mixture with the sawdust along with enough water. The mix must hold together if squeezed; thatโ€s how you determine the ideal consistency. 
Step 2 โ€“ prepare the press 
This step depends on whether youโ€re using a cool home press or an improvised device. Letโ€s say youโ€re on the low-tech side and youโ€re using a plastic bottle mold as an improvised briquette-making device. 
Youโ€ll have to cut the upper quarter of the plastic bottle (a soda bottle will do) and perforate the bottom, making 10-12 drainage holes. You can use a hot wire to burn the holes. 
Then youโ€ll require a thin plastic bag to be used as a liner to help you remove the finished briquette from bottle. Donโ€t forget to punch drainage holes in the plastic bag too, both on the sides and in the bottom, so the water can be expelled during the pressing process. 
Obviously, you can use something bigger than a plastic bottle, like a plastic bucket or a plastic flower pot. Ideally youโ€ll have two of each: one for playing the role of the mold and the second to act as a piston. Donโ€t forget to put drainage holes in the plastic liner though โ€“ otherwise, the water wonโ€t drain and youโ€re wasting your time. 
Step 3 โ€“ press the mix 
In this step, youโ€ll have to put a quantity of briquette-mix inside the plastic liner (bag) and then insert the bag into the mold. Then youโ€ll have to add more mix to the bag and press it with the improvised piston (a can, the other bucket/another bottle or whatever fits into the mold) so the water gets pushed out of the mix. 
Push as hard as you can โ€“ the harder the better. Then youโ€ll have to pull the bag out of the mold and hereโ€s your first briquette, folks. 
Step 4 โ€“ dry your briquettes 
But itโ€s not over yet. Youโ€ll have to dry your briquettes for about a week outside in the sun. If theyโ€re not properly dried, the briquettes will smoke when burned and thatโ€s unpleasant to say the least. 
If you canโ€t improvise a mold and/or a press, you can always make fuel-briquettes with just your hands, squeezing the mix in your bare hands and building fuel balls and youโ€ll have to dry these out too, obviously. 
There are so many survival things you can do by yourself.   discover   wood creations.

72,Dress Like a Woman? What Does That Mean? - The New York Times,Jacey Fortin,"What does it mean to โ€dress like a womanโ€? Social media users took it upon themselves to answer that very question in response to a report that President Trump wants women who work for him to look a certain way. The sentiment was anonymously cited in the new newsletter Axios from Mike Allen, a former Politico reporter. In response, Twitter erupted with a stream of photos showing women dressed for the jobs they hold and the lives they lead, as firefighters, soldiers, police officers and astronauts, to name a few. But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category, the โ€dress like a womanโ€ phrase,   as a hashtag, didnโ€t come directly from Mr. Trump. In his newsletter, Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way: In an email on Friday afternoon, Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details. Itโ€s clear that appearances matter to the president. Mr. Trump, the former owner of the Miss Universe Organization, has come under harsh criticism for rating womenโ€s appearances on a scale of one to 10 and for hurling insults at female critics. As a candidate, he readily attacked when people commented on the size of his hands or on his hair. Like presidents past, Mr. Trump will most likely have some influence over style in the West Wing. The White House does not have an official dress code, according to its Press Office, but every administration has its own norms. For the past two decades, wardrobes have tended to be more relaxed in Democratic administrations. Under President Clinton, โ€aides frequently attended meetings in jeans and โ€ The New York Times reported in 2001. President George W. Bush restored formality to the West Wing, but President Obama was so relaxed that he broke with protocol, foregoing a suit jacket on his first full day in the Oval Office. If the pattern holds, dressing for work in the West Wing could become more formal under the Trump administration. Whether that means women would be required to โ€dress like womenโ€ remains to be seen.",0
73,"At 91, Ella Brennan Still Feeds (and Leads) New Orleans - The New York Times",Brett Anderson,"NEW ORLEANS  โ€”   A typical evening for Ella Brennan begins with cocktails. They are delivered from Commanderโ€s Palace, her familyโ€s restaurant next door to her mansion in this cityโ€s historic Garden District. Drinks are often followed by dinner, also from Commanderโ€s, and wine. Ms. Brennan favors Champagne and distinguished whites from the Cรดte de Beaune because, as she puts it, โ€Iโ€m too damn old to drink cheap wineโ€ and โ€because I can. โ€ In New Orleans, there is little question that Miss Ella, as Ms. Brennan is widely known here, has earned her sense of entitlement. Her hometownโ€s civic pride is tightly linked to its reputation for culinary excellence Ms. Brennan helped create that reputation, and has made maintaining it a personal responsibility for more than 60 years. At 91, she is the matriarch of an extended family of restaurateurs that employs nearly 1, 400 people, both full and part time, and she has mentored countless talents, including the celebrity chefs Paul Prudhomme and Emeril Lagasse. โ€She was there to embrace and elevate, not just me but the entire staff,โ€ said Mr. Lagasse, whom Ms. Brennan plucked from obscurity and installed, at age 23, as Commanderโ€s chef in the early 1980s. โ€The list of people she has impacted in the hospitality industry in America is endless. โ€ Ms. Brennanโ€s family has recently set out to ensure that her legacy is appreciated beyond New Orleans. Those efforts culminated last year with the release of a memoir, โ€Miss Ella of Commanderโ€s Palace,โ€ written with Ti Martin, her daughter. It was followed by the documentary โ€Ella Brennan: Commanding the Table,โ€ directed by Leslie Iwerks. The film, which has been screening at festivals, will be available on Netflix in May. The book and film tell the story of a     businesswoman  โ€”   her other nickname is Hurricane Ella  โ€”   who excelled in a   profession decades before gender imbalance in the restaurant industry became a hot issue. โ€When I first started, you would hardly ever see another woman in the kitchen, much less running the show,โ€ said Sue Zemanick, the former chef at Gautreauโ€s, a โ€Top Chef Mastersโ€ contestant and a line cook at Commanderโ€s early in her career. โ€Working at a restaurant with such strong women in charge gave me hope that I could make it. โ€ While Ms. Brennan is, as Ms. Martin put it, โ€as retired as Mom is capable of being,โ€ her New Orleans restaurants, which include Cafรฉ Adelaide and SoBou, remain an obsession for her they are managed by Ms. Martin and Lally Brennan, a niece of Ms. Brennan. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Brennan sat next to the unlit fireplace in her living room. As she moved a sore leg back and forth between an ottoman and the floor, she suggested that her impulse to empower employees was a rejection of restaurant industry norms she confronted as a young woman. โ€In those days, no one was paying attention to developing people,โ€ she said. โ€A restaurateur has to be part of a team to make something everyone can be proud of. โ€ Her decision to tap Mr. Prudhomme, a Cajun, to run Commanderโ€s kitchen in the 1970s loosened the grip that   chefs had on American fine dining. Alongside Ms. Brennan, and later on his own, the   Mr. Prudhomme helped set the table for a renaissance in American regional cooking that has yet to abate. โ€New Orleans was really the centerpiece of the whole American food movement,โ€ the New York restaurateur Drew Nieporent said. โ€And Ella put New Orleans on the map. โ€ Ms. Brennan entered the hospitality business as a teenager working at the Old Absinthe House, a Bourbon Street bar owned by her brother Owen, 15 years her senior. She had dropped out of a local business school after deciding, as she wrote in her book, that โ€I wasnโ€t going to type for any man. โ€ In 1946, Mr. Brennan bought Vieux Carrรฉ, a French Quarter restaurant that Ms. Brennan described recently, with typical candor, as โ€terrible. โ€ Mr. Brennan hired her to manage the business, looking to prove that an Irish family could operate a restaurant superior to established   restaurants like Arnaudโ€s, Antoineโ€s and Galatoireโ€s. โ€I didnโ€t know anything,โ€ Ms. Brennan recalled. โ€But Owen was a raconteur. He slept till noon. He got me to do all of the things he didnโ€t like. So I learned. โ€ A voracious reader, she pored over books recommended by the restaurantโ€s two chefs, Jack Eames and Paul Blangรฉ, whose respect she sought and whom she frequently praised. โ€I was amazed at their talent,โ€ she said. โ€They were like surgeons. โ€ The gregarious Brennan family  โ€”   the other siblings were Dick, Adelaide, Dottie and John  โ€”   cultivated a clientele of influential locals and visitors, including celebrities. All the while, Ms. Brennan worked with the chefs to elevate Vieux Carrรฉโ€s food. For inspiration, she traveled frequently to New York City, where she became a regular at the โ€21โ€ Club. Culinary pioneers like James Beard and Helen McCully, the food editor of McCallโ€s magazine, took the young visitor under their wings. โ€You had to go to New York in those days,โ€ Ms. Brennan said. โ€I was trying to get New Orleans to that level. โ€ In 1955, the Brennans were preparing to relocate Vieux Carrรฉ to a larger space on Royal Street when Owen died of a heart attack at 45. It fell to Ms. Brennan to carry out her brotherโ€s vision for the new restaurant, which would be called Brennanโ€s. By all accounts, Brennanโ€s ushered in a new age for fine dining in the South. It became a grand showcase for New Orleans joie de vivre, replete with a wine cellar, antiques and food that stretched the boundaries of traditional   cuisine. The national press took notice, especially of its boozy, multicourse breakfasts. โ€America was coming to appreciate dining as entertainment,โ€ Ms. Brennan wrote, โ€and all of the newspapers were just beginning to have columns about food. โ€ Ms. Brennan helped develop new dishes, including bananas Foster. She pushed to expand the familyโ€s restaurant properties, with spotty success, aggravating a rift between Owenโ€s heirs and what came to be known as โ€Ellaโ€s sideโ€ of the family. In 1973, Ms. Brennan was dismissed from Brennanโ€s, initiating a bitter, litigious family split that has never fully healed. โ€It was a tragedy,โ€ Ms. Brennan said. โ€Family is everything to us. โ€ (Owen Brennanโ€s sons continued to run Brennanโ€s until 2013, when a group that includes Ralph Brennan, a son of John Brennan, purchased the   property at a sheriffโ€s auction. Brennanโ€s of Houston, overseen by Ms. Brennanโ€s son Alex, is part of her restaurant group.) Commanderโ€s Palace, which Ms. Brennan acquired in 1969, was a sprawling property in need of repair. In partnership with her sisters and brothers, she set about turning it into a restaurant that would eclipse Brennanโ€s. Early reviews werenโ€t favorable. But over time, Commanderโ€s became renowned for its sophisticated blending of south Louisiana and nouvelle cuisines  โ€”   Ms. Brennan christened the style haute Creole  โ€”   and its warm, celebratory approach to fine dining. โ€We want people who eat here to feel important, and we want them to have fun,โ€ Ms. Brennan said. Ms. Brennan never presumed that her management responsibilities ended at the kitchen door. Alex McCrery, a Commanderโ€s line cook in the early 2000s, recalled that Ms. Brennan admonished another cook for proposing that the kitchen make mustard ice cream. โ€She was the type who was like your mom is when she is disappointed in you,โ€ Mr. McCrery said. โ€She was stern, and youโ€d feel like you really messed up. โ€ Ms. Brennan said she โ€gave up men for Lentโ€ after her divorce in 1970 from Paul Martin. She also never learned to cook (โ€I donโ€t think she can boil water,โ€ Mr. Lagasse said) but that doesnโ€t prevent her from giving lavish dinner parties in the home she shares with Dottie. โ€We donโ€t carry on like we once did,โ€ she said before a recent meal. โ€But I do like to take advantage of living next door to my restaurant. โ€ A waiter carried Ms. Brennanโ€s drink as she moved, with the aid of a walker, from her   parlor to her   dining room. She sat at the head of the table as Commanderโ€s waiters delivered a series of courses from the restaurantโ€s kitchen. As she sank her spoon into a steaming sea urchin and stone crab soufflรฉ, Ms. Brennan explained that entertaining gives her an opportunity to weigh in on new ideas from Tory McPhail, Commanderโ€s current and   chef. It also allows her to partake in the kind of pleasure she has provided others for so long. โ€What weโ€re doing here tonight is letting him experiment on us,โ€ she said, referring to Mr. McPhail, who had just introduced a course of lamb osso buco. Ms. Brennan was as engaged and vivacious as when the evening began. As Mr. McPhail turned to leave, she called after him, โ€Bring back a bottle of Champagne, will you?โ€ Recipe: Bananas Foster",0
74,"Pressing Asia Agenda, Obama Treads Lightly on Human Rights - The New York Times",Jane Perlez,"HANGZHOU, China  โ€”   Human rights barely registered on President Obamaโ€s latest visit to China, which ended Monday night with a news conference at which he made only a glancing reference to differences with Beijing over โ€religious freedom. โ€ And as Mr. Obama moved on to Laos for a summit meeting of Asian nations, human rights advocates worried that their concerns were falling off the American agenda not only with China but also across the region, for the same reason: Beijingโ€s continuing rise as an economic and geopolitical power. As China challenges the United States for influence in Asia, the administration is concerned that any criticism of nations like Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Laos for backsliding on human rights could alienate them rather than pulling them closer. At the same time, shining a spotlight on Chinaโ€s own rough treatment of dissidents risks losing Beijingโ€s cooperation on issues like trade, climate change and nuclear proliferation. Rights advocates accused the administration of being too timid, arguing that the United States should put as much pressure on governments over how they treat their citizens as they do during trade negotiations. โ€Decades of experience should make clear to Washington that Beijing responds only to the expectation of unpleasant consequences,โ€ said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch. โ€Why not threaten sanctions, cut out the pointless pomp or visibly align with peaceful critics of the government?โ€ she said. โ€On other diplomatic, economic and security issues, governments recognize and use these points of leverage. Why not on human rights?โ€ Others say Mr. Obama, who speaks openly about civil rights in the United States, has been wise not to inject the issue into talks with China, even as Beijing has carried out the most sweeping crackdown on Chinese civil society in nearly 20 years. They say the president understands that a more powerful China is better able to resist American pressure on human rights than it was a decade ago. โ€To its credit, the Obama administration has not exacerbated the many U. S.  economic and security issues with a   human rights policy,โ€ said Robert S. Ross, a professor of political science at Boston College. โ€It is quite a stretch to argue that diplomacy could persuade an authoritarian,   government to undermine its domestic political power by allowing greater opposition to the government and tolerating greater political instability. โ€ The pattern is now extending beyond Chinaโ€s borders. During Mr. Obamaโ€s visit to Laos, a tiny country run by a repressive Communist regime, he so far has chosen not to publicly raise the case of an   civil rights worker who disappeared at a police checkpoint four years ago. He has refrained, at least in public, from criticizing the new president of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, who has been unapologetic about waging a violent war against drugs in the first two months of his term. On Wednesday, a day after Mr. Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with Mr. Duterte, who had unleashed a   diatribe against him, the two men met informally. During Mr. Obamaโ€s visit to Vietnam in May, he agreed to lift a longstanding ban on the sale of lethal weapons without winning significant concessions on human rights. And after trying to draw Malaysia closer, Mr. Obama has been embarrassed by the countryโ€s prime minister, Najib Razak, who has closed online news outlets and prosecuted opposition figures in an effort to stay in power. The Obama administration has pressed China on human rights in a   way on only a few occasions. In 2012, the American Embassy in Beijing harbored Chen Guangcheng, a blind Chinese dissident, and flew him to the United States. But the days when the White House could demand and expect the release of a few Chinese political prisoners before a summit meeting are gone, Professor Ross said. As the Chinese Communist Party gained confidence, it began rearresting dissidents who had been released before American summit meetings. โ€Since then,โ€ Professor Ross said, โ€U. S. human rights diplomacy has been reduced to rhetoric, which, no surprise, has not improved Chinaโ€s human rights situation. โ€ Despite Mr. Obamaโ€s fleeting public reference to religious repression this week, for example, few expect the Chinese authorities to retreat from a campaign against Christian churches in the area surrounding Hangzhou, the city that hosted the Group of 20 meeting. One of the new challenges for Mr. Obama, and one for his successor, will be how to deal with Mr. Duterte. The police in the Philippines say they have killed about 1, 000 suspects in the antidrug campaign, and about 300 people have been killed by vigilantes. Rights groups have urged the United States to do something about the situation. โ€Itโ€d be difficult for us to overstate how grave the situation has become in the Philippines,โ€ said John Sifton, the deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch. โ€At this rate, weโ€re talking about over 6, 000 people dead by the end of the year. โ€ But the Philippines is an American ally and a bulwark against Chinese military gains in the South China Sea. By that calculus, the United States cannot afford to alienate Mr. Duterte. Philippine analysts say that Mr. Duterte is on good terms with Chinese business executives who invested in Davao, the city where he served as mayor, and that he may be open to negotiating with Beijing over the South China Sea. Under American legislation known as the Leahy Amendment, Washington is obliged to cut off assistance to Philippines law enforcement units that are suspected of human rights abuses. But Antonio La Viรฑa, a professor of government at Ateneo de Manila University, said the threat of such a sanction was unlikely to be effective. โ€The truth is that the Philippines has the money to modernize our military,โ€ he said. Mr. Obama is the first sitting American president to visit Laos, and he has sought to promote reconciliation with the nation, on which the United States dropped more than two million tons of bombs at the height of the Vietnam War. But he is also being called on to press Laosโ€s repressive government  โ€”   a traditional ally of China  โ€”   on the case of Sombath Somphone, a civil rights campaigner and   agriculture specialist who disappeared at a police checkpoint in the capital, Vientiane, four years ago. Mr. Obama will also have to decide how hard to push concerns about human rights with other leaders at the meeting, several of whom are being wooed by China. One of Mr. Obamaโ€s favorite Southeast Asian leaders, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar, is scheduled to visit the White House this month, and American officials hope to make progress on addressing the plight of the Rohingya, a persecuted Muslim minority in the predominantly Buddhist country. More than 100, 000 Rohingya live in   camps in northern Myanmar, and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has appointed a commission that includes the former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan to find solutions. โ€She has demonstrated a recognition that this is a problem that must be solved,โ€ said Tom Malinowski, the United States assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor. The Obama administration has been less vocal on conditions in Vietnam, which it has tried to steer closer to the United States in the face of Chinese pressure over territorial disputes in the South China Sea. Since then, the human rights situation has only deteriorated, said Nguyen Quang A, an activist and a former member of the Vietnamese Communist Party who was invited to meet Mr. Obama in Hanoi but who was stopped by Vietnamese security forces. Political prisoners remain in jail, the news media is muzzled, and independent labor unions have not been allowed, despite promises to Washington. โ€Should Obama have done more to try and influence the government of Vietnam?โ€ Mr. Quang A asked. โ€Absolutely. โ€",0
75,Democrats Have a 60 Percent Chance to Retake the Senate - The New York Times,Josh Katz,"The Upshotโ€s new Senate election forecast gives Democrats a 60 percent chance of winning control of the chamber in November. Included within this 60 percent is a 17 percent chance that the Senate ends up evenly split with a Democratic vice president providing the tiebreaking vote. By our count, the Democrats need to win five seats among the 11 most competitive races. (The Democrats will need to win six if Donald J. Trump wins the presidential race we put Mr. Trumpโ€s chances of winning at only  11 percent). Ten of these seats are held by Republicans, and one by a Democrat, Harry Reid of Nevada, who is retiring. That the Democrats are favored in this election should not be surprising. The 2016 Senate elections boded well for the Democrats without any consideration of a possible Trump effect on   races. In recent history, Democrats have done better in presidential election years than in midterm years, when turnout is lower. Most of the senators up for   last went before the voters in the Republican wave election of 2010  โ€”   when the G. O. P. made big and broad gains in an   environment  โ€”   leaving Republicans with several potentially vulnerable incumbents. This year, the Democrats are defending only 10 seats while the Republicans have to preserve 24. On fundamentals alone  โ€”   that is, historical voting patterns, the candidatesโ€ political experience and    โ€”   the Democrats would have about a   shot to win the Senate. The latest Senate polling improves this figure to 60 percent. The framework for our model is broadly similar to the approach we took in 2014, when our Election Day forecast correctly called 35 of 36 Senate races. That approach means starting with the fundamentals as a prior, then updating those beliefs as polling information comes in. We let races affect one another and assume that the    errors will be correlated. The main difference between 2014 and this year is that we have some additional information to gauge candidatesโ€ chances in a presidential year. Previous research suggests that there is a strong relationship between presidential and Senate voting. Accordingly, our model assumes that Senate races will track the presidential race in each state to some degree. That is, if Hillary Clinton has improved her standing in the presidential forecast since the last time a state has been polled, we โ€ โ€ the Senate polling average a small amount in the same direction. Incumbents are running in seven of the 10 seats being defended by Democrats. All seven seats are considered safe. For the other three: โ–  Democrats are guaranteed to win the seat in California: Barbara Boxer is retiring, and two Democrats  โ€”   Kamala Harris and Loretta Sanchez  โ€”   won the top two spots in an open primary. โ–  Initial polling in Maryland showed the Democratic candidate, Chris Van Hollen, up by 20 to 30 points. โ–  Itโ€s only in Nevada, where Catherine Cortez Masto is trying to replace Mr. Reid, where the election is competitive. This leaves Democrats with 36 seats that are not up for election this year  โ€”   including two independents, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who both caucus with Democrats  โ€”   in addition to nine safe seats. Much of the weakness in the Republican position comes from seven G. O. P. incumbents in mostly   states trying to win a second term after first being elected in the Republican wave year of 2010: Ron Johnson in Wisconsin, Mark Kirk in Illinois, Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Roy Blunt in Missouri, Rob Portman in Ohio, and Marco Rubio in Florida (assuming he wins the Republican primary next week). In addition, the retirement of the Republican Dan Coats along with the entry of the former Democratic senator Evan Bayh in the race in Indiana shifted that seat from a likely Republican hold to a possible Democratic pickup. Richard Burrโ€s seat in North Carolina also seems vulnerable. Polling indicates that even Senator John McCain of Arizona could be swept out by the encroaching Democratic tide. If Mr. McCain beats back a primary challenge from the Tea Party candidate Kelli Ward, he will face a Democratic challenger, Ann Kirkpatrick, who was within two points in a June poll. Our model gives Ms. Kirkpatrick a roughly    chance of taking the seat. To give themselves a cushion in retaking the Senate, Democrats would probably need to win six of these 11 races: the seven elections with   Republicans the elections in Indiana, Arizona and North Carolina and the contest for Mr. Reidโ€s seat in Nevada. If Mrs. Clinton wins the presidency and they win five seats, they will most likely control that chamber because the vice president has the tiebreaking vote in the Senate. With so many seats remaining uncertain, the race could still tip in either direction, with Republicans possibly retaining a slim majority or Democrats running the table. As of today, the most likely outcome is a tie.",0
76,"News: PR Disaster: The President Of Panasonic Has Been Forced To Resign After 60,000 Panasonic TVs Ascended To Heaven Without Warning",nan,"Email 
Get ready for the most cringeworthy story youโ€re going to read all day. 
Panasonic might be one of the largest electronics manufacturers in the world, but after today, they may find themselves struggling to stay afloat. The companyโ€s president has been forced to resign in disgrace after 60,000 Panasonic TVs abruptly ascended to heaven without warning. 
Weโ€ll give you a minute to finish shaking your head. 
The scandal broke early last night when 60,000 of the companyโ€s popular DX802-model flat-screen TVs from all over the world silently lifted off of the ground and, despite their owners yelling at them to stop and trying to drag them back down to Earth, floated away from the mortal realm and into the kingdom of heaven to reside with the immortal seraphim for all eternity. 
Yikes. Needless to say, Panasonic customers are not happy! Only a few minutes after the televisions began their skyward journey to the kingdom of God, Panasonic found themselves completely inundated with tweets like this: 
Wow. Panasonic definitely wishes it could rewind the clock on this one! Chances are, when youโ€re trying to stay competitive as one of the worldโ€s foremost electronics companies, the last thing you want is for tens of thousands of your televisions to drift skyward into paradise. 
Weโ€ve got to give credit where credit is due: At least Panasonic had the decency to admit that they let their customers down. The company has issued a public apology, and in a drastic move, the president of the company, Kazuhiro Tsuga, chose to resign in the wake of this scandal. Speaking at a press conference this morning, Tsuga issued the following statement: 
โ€After much consideration, I have chosen to step down as the president of Panasonic Corp. If I could, I would travel to Heaven and retrieve each and every one of these televisions. I would kill any angel who tried to stop me from carrying these TVs out of paradise and returning them to our loyal Panasonic customers on Earth. Even if I saw God sitting on one of our missing DX802 flat-screens, I would shove the Lord off of the TV so that I could retrieve it for our customers. Unfortunately, I do not have the power to travel to Heaven, and so I am left with no choice but to resign my position.โ€ 
Tsugaโ€s resignation is a nice gesture, but it doesnโ€t bring back a swarm of televisions from heaven. Panasonicโ€s reputation has been severely tarnished by the rapturing of their televisions. Whoever steps up to become Panasonicโ€s new president is going to have to do everything they can to prevent any of their products from ascending to heaven ever again.",1
77,Judge spanks transgender-obsessed Obama: You lie! | RedFlag News,Redflag Newsdesk,"
Bob Unruh | WND 
For a third time, a federal judge has affirmed a nationwide injunction against the Obama administrationโ€s agenda to impose mandatory open-restroom policies on schools from coast to coast, scolding the White House for repeating old arguments and catching those who submitted the newest arguments in a lie. 
The ruling this week from U.S. District Judge Reed Oโ€Connor left intact his nationwide injunction against Obamaโ€s decision that transgender public school students can use the restroom of their choice, rather than the restroom designated for their physical sex. 
The White House issued the order some months ago, and when several states sued, Oโ€Connor found in August that they were likely to prevail in their arguments, so he suspended implementation of the program nationwide. 
In October, when he had to address the issue again because of demands from the White House, he doubled down, stating, โ€It is clear from Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit precedent that this court has the power to issue a nationwide injunction where appropriate. Both Title IX and Title VII rely on the consistent, uniform application of national standards in education and workplace policy. 
โ€A nationwide injunction is necessary because the alleged violation extends nationwide. Defendants are a group of agencies and administrators capable of enforcing their guidelines nationwide, affecting numerous state and school district facilities across the country.โ€ 
Now in another ruling prompted by demands from the Obama administration, Oโ€Connor has affirmed the decision โ€“ again. ",1
78,51 U.S. Diplomats Urge Strikes Against Assad in Syria - The New York Times,Mark Landler,"WASHINGTON  โ€”   More than 50 State Department diplomats have signed an internal memo sharply critical of the Obama administrationโ€s policy in Syria, urging the United States to carry out military strikes against the government of President Bashar   to stop its persistent violations of a   in the countryโ€s    civil war. The memo, a draft of which was provided to The New York Times by a State Department official, says American policy has been โ€overwhelmedโ€ by the unrelenting violence in Syria. It calls for โ€a judicious use of   and air weapons, which would undergird and drive a more focused and   U. S.  diplomatic process. โ€ Such a step would represent a radical shift in the administrationโ€s approach to the civil war in Syria, and there is little evidence that President Obama has plans to change course. Mr. Obama has emphasized the military campaign against the Islamic State over efforts to dislodge Mr. Assad. Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, have all but collapsed. But the memo, filed in the State Departmentโ€s โ€dissent channel,โ€ underscores the deep rifts and lingering frustration within the administration over how to deal with a war that has killed more than 400, 000 people. The State Department set up the channel during the Vietnam War as a way for employees who had disagreements with policies to register their protest with the secretary of state and other top officials, without fear of reprisal. While dissent cables are not that unusual, the number of signatures on this document, 51, is extremely large, if not unprecedented. The names on the memo are almost all midlevel officials  โ€”   many of them career diplomats  โ€”   who have been involved in the administrationโ€s Syria policy over the last five years, at home or abroad. They range from a Syria desk officer in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs to a former deputy to the American ambassador in Damascus. While there are no widely recognized names,   State Department officials are known to share their concerns. Mr. Kerry himself has pushed for stronger American action against Syria, in part to force a diplomatic solution on Mr. Assad. The president has resisted such pressure, and has been backed up by his military commanders, who have raised questions about what would happen in the event that Mr. Assad was forced from power  โ€”   a scenario that the draft memo does not address. The State Department spokesman, John Kirby, declined to comment on the memo, which top officials had just received. But he said Mr. Kerry respected the process as a way for employees โ€to express policy views candidly and privately to senior leadership. โ€ Robert S. Ford, a former ambassador to Syria, said, โ€Many people working on Syria for the State Department have long urged a tougher policy with the Assad government as a means of facilitating arrival at a negotiated political deal to set up a new Syrian government. โ€ Mr. Ford, who is now a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, resigned from the Foreign Service in 2014 out of frustration with the administrationโ€s   policy toward the conflict. In the memo, the State Department officials wrote that the Assad governmentโ€s continuing violations of the partial   known as a cessation of hostilities, will doom efforts to broker a political settlement because Mr. Assad will feel no pressure to negotiate with the moderate opposition or other factions fighting him. The governmentโ€s barrel bombing of civilians, it said, is the โ€root cause of the instability that continues to grip Syria and the broader region. โ€ โ€The moral rationale for taking steps to end the deaths and suffering in Syria, after five years of brutal war, is evident and unquestionable,โ€ it said. โ€The status quo in Syria will continue to present increasingly dire, if not disastrous, humanitarian, diplomatic and   challenges. โ€ The memo acknowledged that military action would have risks, not the least further tensions with Russia, which has intervened in the war on Mr. Assadโ€s behalf and helped negotiate a  . Those tensions increased on Thursday when, according to a senior Pentagon official, Russia conducted airstrikes in southern Syria against   forces fighting the Islamic State. The State Department officials insisted in their memo that they were not โ€advocating for a slippery slope that ends in a military confrontation with Russia,โ€ but rather a credible threat of military action to keep Mr. Assad in line. Once that threat was in place, the memo said, Mr. Kerry could undertake a diplomatic mission similar to the one he led with Iran on its nuclear program. The expression of dissent came a week after Mr. Assad showed renewed defiance of the United States and other countries, vowing to retake โ€every inchโ€ of his country from his enemies. The   which Mr. Kerry helped negotiate in Munich last winter, has never really taken hold. Mr. Assad has continued to block humanitarian convoys, despite a warning that the United Nations would begin airdrops of food to starving towns. โ€There is an enormous frustration in the bureaucracy about Syria policy,โ€ said Andrew J. Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near Eastern Policy. โ€Whatโ€s brought this to a head now is the real downturn in the negotiations, not just between the U. S. and Russia, but between Assad and the opposition. โ€ Last month, Mr. Kerry rejected the suggestion that the United States and its allies would never use force to stop the bombings or enforce humanitarian access. โ€If President Assad has come to a conclusion thereโ€s no Plan B,โ€ he said, โ€then heโ€s come to a conclusion that is totally without any foundation whatsoever and even dangerous. โ€ Still, Mr. Obama has shown little sign of shifting his focus from the campaign against the Islamic State  โ€”   a strategy that probably acquired even more urgency after the mass shooting Sunday in Orlando, Fla. In the memo, the State Department officials argued that military action against Mr. Assad would help the fight against the Islamic State because it would bolster moderate Sunnis, who are necessary allies against the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. While the State Department has a tradition of being open to dissent  โ€”   in the 1990s, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with Foreign Service officers who had written a   dissent on the Clinton administrationโ€s Balkans policy  โ€”   Mr. Christopher and his successors have been frustrated when these classified memos become public. In this case, the memo mainly confirms what has been clear for some time: The State Departmentโ€s rank and file have chafed at the White Houseโ€s refusal to be drawn into the conflict in Syria. During a debate in June 2013, after the Assad government had used chemical weapons against its own people, Mr. Kerry brandished a State Department report that argued that the United States needed to respond militarily or Mr. Assad would view it as โ€green light for continued CW use. โ€ Three years later, the sense of urgency at the State Department has not diminished. The memo concludes, โ€It is time that the United States, guided by our strategic interests and moral convictions, lead a global effort to put an end to this conflict once and for all. โ€",0

80,"Louisiana, Simone Biles, U.S. Presidential Race: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing - The New York Times",Andrea Kannapell and Sandra Stevenson,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Hereโ€s the  .) Good evening. Hereโ€s the latest. 1. Floodwaters saturated southern Louisiana, forcing more desperate rescues and evacuations. The death toll rose to 11, and tens of thousands of people have been displaced. Some areas have received as much as 31 inches of rain (yes, 31) in the last week  โ€”   a     phenomenon that some experts say foretells the disasters of climate change. _____ 2. At the Olympics, the spectacular American gymnast Simone Biles scooped up her fourth gold medal, soaring past the competition in the floor exercise. More of todayโ€s highlights are here. Fans of the U. S. runner Allyson Felix raged over a dive across the finish line by the Bahamian Shaunae Miller to win the womenโ€s 400 meters. And an Irish boxer, Michael Conlon, raged against judges after they ruled he lost to a Russian, Vladimir Nikitin, in a bout many observers believed he had won. Our full coverage of the Games is here, including the   battle for the 2024 Olympics and a meditation on the sometimes mystifying theatrics in synchronized swimming. _____ 3. Donald Trump spoke at a rally in a suburb of Milwaukee, steering clear of the area where unrest flared after a fatal police shooting. He accused Hillary Clinton of pushing an   โ€narrativeโ€ and said, โ€Law and order must be restored. โ€ His campaign focus has shifted to the theme of fighting terrorism, with a special focus on protecting women. Heโ€s also portraying Hillary Clinton as weak and tired. _____ 4. Four sources told our political reporters that Roger Ailes, the Fox News chairman ousted last month over accusations of sexual harassment, is advising Donald Trump as he prepares for the coming presidential debates. A Trump spokeswoman issued a denial, saying the two are friends and โ€speak occasionally, which isnโ€t news. โ€ _____ 5. Hillary Clinton traveled to Philadelphia for a   drive, bolstered by new polls showing her lead strengthening in Florida. Her campaign is spending heavily to influence early voting, which is allowed in 35 states and the District of Columbia. The first, Minnesota, begins on Sept. 23. Almost   of voters cast early ballots in 2012. The F. B. I. under pressure from House Republicans, gave Congress classified documents related to its investigation of Mrs. Clintonโ€s private email server. _____ 6. Russia launched air attacks in Syria from an air base in Iran, becoming the first foreign military to operate from Iranian territory since at least World War II. The move could alter the political and military equation in the Middle East. The Russian military said its bombers destroyed ammunition dumps and other targets linked to the Islamic State and other groups. _____ 7. Turns out older people are pretty good life hackers. A professor of industrial design has been collecting examples: using the moldable putty Sugru to buffer furniture edges that can bruise or tear elderly skin, and snapping rubber bands around cups to increase grip. A    woman who put a lazy susan in her refrigerator to ease access said, โ€Designers think they can put themselves in the shoes of the aging, but you donโ€t really know until youโ€ve lived with the realities. โ€ _____ 8. Gawker will be getting a new owner. Univisionโ€s bid of $135 million secured the muckraking gossip site at auction, according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal. Gawker declared bankruptcy after being hit with a $140 million judgment for publishing a sex tape involving the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. Above, Nick Denton, who founded Gawker in 2002. _____ 9. Google released Duo, a   app that can place video calls between Android and iPhone users. In a jab at Apple, whose FaceTime operates only with iOS, Googleโ€s statement said users shouldnโ€t have to worry โ€if your friend is using the same type of device as you are. โ€ _____ 10. Wen Hair Care, created by a Los Angeles stylist to the stars, has drawn more than 21, 000 complaints, including hair loss in women and children. Its distributor is part of a trade association bitterly fighting proposed legislation that would empower the Food and Drug Administration to test and recall cosmetics. But the proposal has the backing of the bigger players in the beauty industry, who want to regain public trust. _____ 11.

83,Colin Kaepernick Starts Black Panther-Inspired Youth Camp? Wow!,Scott Osborn,"0 comments Colin Kaepernick has started a kids camp inspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan and said he didnโ€t want the media to find out. 
Well I wonder why he would not want the media to find out he was taking such a far out approach with children? 
MAYBE his goal is to make little Black Panthers out of our youth? The NY DAILY NEWS reports: 
Please donโ€t say anything about it online,โ€ Colin asked me a few days before the camp. โ€Iโ€m not doing this for the press and I donโ€t want it to become a media event so that the kids and the families can feel like this is just for them.โ€ 
nspired by the Black Panther Party, and their popular 10 point plan, on their 50th Anniversary, the camp created 10 rights that each child has the right to know. They were listed on the back of T-shirts given to each camper. 
โ€Weโ€re here today to fight back and give you all lessons to combat the oppressive issues that our people face on a daily basis. Weโ€re here to give you tools to help you succeed,โ€ he said. โ€Weโ€re going to give you knowledge on policing history, what the systems of policing in America were based on, and weโ€re also going to teach you skills to make sure you always make it home safely.โ€ 
Why couldnโ€t Kaepernick just be normal and do something good for kids? Why so secretive? Why push such an extreme political agenda from an extremist group? 
Kaepernick could have taken another road. He has instead taken an anti-American, anti-Law Enforcement road. He has chosen the road of hate and divisiveness instead of the road of Patriotism and unity. 
Kaepernick wants to pass this line of reasoning on to children. insanity on many levels.",1
84,Trumpโ€s Immigration Policies Explained - The New York Times,"Nicholas Kulish, Vivian Yee, Caitlin Dickerson, Liz Robbins, Fernanda Santos and Jennifer Medina","With an executive order last month and a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos on Tuesday, the Trump administration has significantly hardened the countryโ€s policies regarding illegal immigration. Here are some of the most significant elements of the new approach: In 2014, the Obama administration issued guidelines for deporting unauthorized immigrants that placed the highest priority on gang members, felons and those who posed security threats. A goal was to concentrate limited resources on the most serious cases, but many Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents complained that the priorities tied their hands, taking away their discretion as to whom to pursue. Under the new directives, the government โ€no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. โ€ Immigration agents can now focus on picking up and removing anyone charged with or convicted of any criminal offense, even minor ones, as well as anyone already ordered deported, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. One unauthorized immigrant in California, Kristina, who did not want her last name used because of fear of deportation, said she was alarmed to learn on Tuesday that she would now be considered a prime target. Kristina has been in the country for 25 years and has been ordered deported, but her removal had been postponed for the last four years by the Obama administration. โ€We have our whole lives here our children are citizens,โ€ she said. โ€Now I donโ€t know if I can go out, if I should drive. โ€ But the Obama guidelines โ€translated into de facto protectionsโ€ for people with no legal right to live in the United States, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants. Unless they fell into one of the   categories, Mr. Stein said, โ€the chance of being deported was virtually zero. โ€ Under the Obama administration, people caught crossing the border without permission were often released into the United States while their requests for asylum wound through the immigration system, a process that can take years. Most requests are denied, but by then, the immigrant has been living in the United States all that time and may not be easy to find. The Trump administration has declared an end to the   catch and release policy, though it may take awhile to see any significant change. โ€Catch and releaseโ€ came about in part because the government had nowhere to hold detainees waiting for immigration decisions. One of the memos released on Tuesday directs officials to expand detention facilities, but it will take time to build centers big enough, or find enough room in jails, to hold the thousands of Mexican and Central American asylum seekers expected to cross the border this year. The document also raises another alternative: sending migrants back to Mexico to wait out the immigration process, even those who are not originally from Mexico. That proposal comes with its own problems. Though United States law appears to allow it, Mexicoโ€s laws do not, if the immigrant is not a Mexican citizen. Two decades ago, Congress passed a law allowing the government to quickly deport undocumented immigrants who have not been in the United States very long, without allowing them go before a judge. In practice, the government has used this process, called โ€expedited removal,โ€ relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Since 2002, expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. That is because the Supreme Court has held that such immigrants can still be considered โ€in transitโ€ and not here long enough to qualify for due process protections. The Trump administration is now planning to use expedited removal as extensively as the original law allows, saying that limits on its use had contributed to a backlog of more than half a million cases in immigration court. Immigration advocates vowed to challenge the change. โ€Someone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent,โ€ said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A. C. L. U.โ€s Immigrantsโ€ Rights Project, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. โ€He is going to be detained and removed right away without ever seeing a judge. โ€ One of the memos on Tuesday acknowledges that children who arrive at the border alone  โ€”   โ€unaccompanied alien children,โ€ in government parlance  โ€”   are entitled to special protections: Unlike other border crossers, whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing, these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer. Children have surged across the border in recent years, many fleeing violence and destitution in Central America. But the memo turns a sterner face to their parents, who, under the new policy, may be subject to deportation or even prosecution for enabling their children to come into the country. The memo notes that parents and relatives often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children from Central America, an act that the memo says amounts to facilitating illegal smuggling or trafficking. Immigration advocates are predicting that the policy will drive parents of migrant children further underground. With parents fearful of prosecution, advocates say, navigating the immigration process  โ€”   or even showing up to court  โ€”   could become much harder for these children. Some 750, 000 people who were brought into the country as children were issued work permits and temporary protection from deportation under an Obama program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Even President Trump said last week that the subject โ€is very, very difficultโ€ for him and that he promised to โ€deal with DACA with heart. โ€ So far, the Trump administration has left the program alone. But chills went through the community of โ€Dreamers,โ€ as DACA recipients are known, with the recent arrest of a    Mexican immigrant in Washington State, Daniel Ramirez. Immigration agents arrested him when they went to his house to detain his father, a convicted drug trafficker. They said Mr. Ramirez admitted to having gang affiliations, which cancels the protection offered under DACA. But Mr. Ramirez denies having made the admission, and his lawyers are fighting his deportation. A program known as 287( g) named for its section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows the Department of Homeland Security to train local and state law enforcement officers to work as de facto federal immigration officers, identifying undocumented immigrants in their communities and jails and turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. From 2006 to 2013, the program led to 175, 000 deportations, according to federal statistics. But investigations and court rulings revealed an ugly side effect: In some jurisdictions, local officers were using their authority to racially profile Latinos. One of the most egregious cases was in Maricopa County, Arizonaโ€s most populous, during the tenure of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, who a federal judge ruled had discriminated against Latinos in patrols and other enforcement efforts. The Obama administration curtailed the use of the program, which currently involves 32 agencies in 16 states. The Trump administration wants more agencies to take part, and some have already expressed a desire to do so. The administration is trying to significantly expand the amount of information available on the enforcement of immigration laws and, in particular, unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will establish a new office to work with the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom appeared with Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The office, known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will provide victims with information about defendantsโ€ immigration status and whether they are in jail. Significantly, funding for the office comes from reallocating โ€any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliensโ€ by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases. The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails. That is a clear shot across the bow at   sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, contending that turning in unauthorized immigrants would destroy the fragile relationship that the police have with immigrant communities. โ€We are going to continue our policy that has been in place because we think that it helps us have a safer, stronger, better community,โ€ Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse said on Tuesday. The Trump administration is already pondering ways to punish those cities by denying them some federal aid. โ€Now everyone is going to be able to see how many criminal aliens are being released as a result of the sanctuary policies,โ€ said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. In January 2009, the departing Bush administration extended some Privacy Act rights, which American citizens and legal permanent residents already had, to undocumented immigrants. That meant that information obtained by one agency, like the Internal Revenue Service or Citizenship and Immigration Services, could not generally be shared with other agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One rationale for the move was to protect the personal information of immigrants who might one day become citizens covered by the Privacy Act. The Trump administration has now rescinded those privacy protections. One of the memos released on Tuesday said that those protections had been detrimental to the families of the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, because those families could not get information about such defendantsโ€ legal status, or whether they had been deported, leaving victims โ€feeling marginalized and without a voice. โ€ The Department of Homeland Security said it would develop new rules on the sharing of undocumented immigrantsโ€ private information. But advocates for unauthorized immigrants said they feared that immigrants who had applied for legal status  โ€”   in the process divulging they were not here legally  โ€”   were now in danger of having that information used to deport them. โ€The constitution doesnโ€t traditionally allow bait and switches,โ€ said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an organization that advocates for immigrants. โ€These are folks who submitted their information attempting to play by the rules, with part of the rules being that the government would protect their privacy. โ€ The memos released on Tuesday repeat Mr. Trumpโ€s demand in his executive order for a larger enforcement force that can speed up the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States. In practice, that may play out more slowly than the president might prefer. The source of this caution is none other than John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15, 000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years. โ€Iโ€d rather have fewer and make sure that theyโ€re   people,โ€ Mr. Kelly told lawmakers. โ€I will not skimp on the training and the standards. โ€ On top of the stringent hiring standards and training, Border Patrol applicants are required to take a polygraph test, which nearly 60 percent fail. A previous surge in hiring under President George W. Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases, with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.",0

Dick Van Dyke, who played Ms. Mooreโ€s husband in the 1960s sitcom โ€The Dick Van Dyke Show,โ€ said on Twitter that Ms. Moore had changed his life for the better. Other former   and   friends also shared their grief and gratitude online.

87,Trump Fans Rally Across the Nation to Support the President - The New York Times,Jack Healy,"DENVER  โ€”   As Americans poured into airport terminals, public squares and congressional town   meetings over the past month to vent their anger over President Trumpโ€s policies, Debbie Dooley started hearing from fellow conservatives. โ€Phone call after phone call from people: โ€Why arenโ€t we out supporting President Trump? โ€โ€ said Ms. Dooley, a Tea Party activist in Georgia. So on Monday, conservatives around the country got out the Make America Great Again hats, unfurled American flags and held rallies at state capitols and on courthouse steps, seeking to rekindle the populist fervor that helped vault Mr. Trump to the White House and stick up for a president whose approval ratings have taken a beating during five   weeks in office. But the modest crowds that showed up for the noontime rallies from New Jersey to Georgia to Colorado offered a reminder of what liberal groups learned eight years ago in the face of Tea Party anger at President Barack Obama: Stoking   energy is often easier for the outraged resistance than for the party pulling the levers in Washington. โ€Iโ€m getting a lot of comments from the leftists about, โ€Your crowdโ€s not going to be as big as our crowd,โ€โ€ said Betty Blanco, a retired teacher from La Junta, Colo. on the stateโ€s conservative eastern plains, who organized a rally on the steps of the   State Capitol. โ€I didnโ€t know it was a contest. โ€ About 150 Trump supporters turned out for Mondayโ€s rally in Denver, held just across the street from a park that had swelled with tens of thousands of protesters as part of the Womenโ€s March on Jan. 21. Organizers said Mondayโ€s rallies, held a day before the president addresses a joint session of Congress, bubbled up organically from Trump supporters who felt he was being treated unfairly by Democrats and the news media. Some people said the ferocity of that criticism had actually nudged them closer to Mr. Trump. โ€I was mad at Trump for a while, absolutely,โ€ said Steve Foose, a bus driver in Middletown, N. J. and   former Democrat who joined about 200 people waving signs and flags along the curb of a   crossroads. โ€I just grew to like him, and I would lay down my life for him. โ€ Mondayโ€s rallies were filled with prayer, choruses of โ€God Bless Americaโ€ and speeches about cutting taxes and regulations. People applauded the president and veterans, and urged one another to stay positive. But there were also chants of โ€Lock her up!โ€ every so often, and a few shouting matches when Trump critics wandered by and yelled at the crowds. People praised Mr. Trump for actions that have provoked protests and lawsuits from the left. In interviews at five rallies on Monday, his supporters said that he was breaking the china in Washington, cracking down on immigration and supporting American businesses, and that they were getting frustrated that more people did not seem to see it that way. In Atlanta, Jermane Enoch, 57, a project manager from Powder Springs, Ga. was among the few   in a largely white crowd of 200 who rallied on the presidentโ€s behalf at Liberty Plaza, in the shadow of the State Capitol. Wearing a red Trump hat, a patriotic bow tie and a Trump   Mr. Enoch said that good businesspeople would understand why Mondayโ€s rallies across the country were needed, given what he said was the โ€negative messagingโ€ from   protesters and the news media. โ€Itโ€s necessary to have a show of continuous support, just like itโ€s necessary for businesses to show continuous improvement,โ€ he said. Mr. Enoch argued that the president had been mischaracterized and misunderstood. The idea that Mr. Trump is a racist, as some critics contend, struck him as balderdash. In a   turn at the microphone, Mr. Enoch said his support for Mr. Trump superseded race, and he urged a return to conservative values. Mr. Enoch brandished a pocket Constitution, to much applause. And he took a cue from Isaiah as he said Mr. Trumpโ€s supporters should not be cowed by counterprotest: โ€I am not afraid!โ€ he said. โ€No weapon that is formed against us shall prosper!โ€ RICHARD FAUSSET In Mandeville, a city in one of Louisianaโ€s most conservative parishes, there was some question as to how many Trump supporters would materialize, this being the usually quiet eve of Mardi Gras. But there was little doubt that those who showed up  โ€”   150 or so bikers, retirees,   police officers and others  โ€”   would be   in their support for a president who won the parish by roughly three to one. A home remodeler and disc jockey who uses the name Bobby Blaze made the most   entrance, wearing a suit over his leather โ€Brotherhood of Bikersโ€ vest, a bright red tie with a gold clip and, to top it all off, a   Trump wig. He said that his father, a World War II veteran who died two years ago, would have loved Mr. Trump: โ€โ€The country needs John Wayne,โ€ thatโ€s what he used to say. โ€ And after aiding its allies around the globe for decades, Mr. Blaze suggested, the United States had finally gotten such a   leader at a time when it needed him most. โ€We canโ€t help the world,โ€ he said, โ€till we can help ourselves first. โ€ CAMPBELL ROBERTSON In Cabarrus County, N. C. which Mr. Trump easily carried, more than 150 of his supporters met up outside the courthouse in Concord, many of them unfurling last yearโ€s Trump campaign flags, lawn signs and red caps  โ€”   though a surprising number said they had never attended a Trump rally during the presidential race. Bill Cagle, a retiree, decided to attend on Monday after seeing a deluge of news coverage of   demonstrations in the streets and at congressional town halls. โ€I said, โ€Well, weโ€ve been silent long enough, and weโ€ve really got to say whatโ€s in the heart,โ€ when I saw all of this vitriol the last six weeks,โ€ Mr. Cagle said. An operations manager for a company that builds towers for   lines, Mr. Cagle said he was a registered Democrat but had not voted for the partyโ€s presidential ticket in decades. He said he maintained his registration only to vote against what he considered the worst option in a primary race. โ€What heโ€s done in a little bit of time, I think is great,โ€ he said of Mr. Trump, noting in particular his efforts to roll back regulations. โ€Iโ€ve been in business, and by golly, if they can get rid of some of that, itโ€s great. โ€ TRIP GABRIEL On the edges of the Denver crowd, two men exemplified the devotion and the dread that the president inspires. Ron Kamstra, a retired civil engineer and   Christian who said he deeply supported Mr. Trumpโ€s stances on terrorism and immigration, handed out photocopied passages of the Quran that he said encouraged violence. Mohamed Mashkooke, an accountant born in Somalia, wandered up to Mr. Kamstra and said he was growing increasingly worried about becoming the target of racist attacks  โ€”   like the shooting last week of two Indian men in Kansas. Cordially at first, but then increasingly tensely, the men argued about religion, immigration, faith and the validity of Mr. Obamaโ€s birth certificate. (Despite all of the facts, Mr. Kamstra is still dubious.) โ€I donโ€t hate Trump,โ€ Mr. Mashkooke said finally, walking away, โ€but I think heโ€s crazy. โ€ โ€O. K. good,โ€ Mr. Kamstra replied, and turned back to the speeches. JACK HEALY",0
88,Fox Biz Reporter Can't Help But Bash Clintonโ€s Rally After Covering Trumpโ€s Packed Event Day Before,Kayla Brandon,"Share on Twitter 
The battle of campaign rallies has been going strong throughout the 2016 presidential election, with both candidates amassing pretty large crowds. 
Just last month, the Washington Post compared two separate September rallies for both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. 
Trump's had a crowd of 15,000, at his Sept. 27th rally in Melbourne, Florida: Unbelievable evening in Melbourne, Florida w/ 15,000 supporters- and an additional 12,000 who could not get in. Thank you! #TrumpTrain #MAGA pic.twitter.com/2N3Xq7AGmx โ€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 28, 2016

It appears as though Fox Business reporter Adam Shapiro felt the need to compare Trump and Hillary's crowd attendance, too. 
At a West Palm Beach rally Wednesday, Shapiro said there appeared to be roughly a thousand Hillary supporters at Palm Beach State College, which was a sizable difference to Trump's rally the day before: 
""It's nowhere near the size of the crowd we saw in Sanford, Florida yesterday for Mr. Trump โ€” 15,000. 
Take a look, Stewart [camera pans crowd]. 
There's maybe 1,000 to 2,000 people here today. The Clinton rallies tend to be much smaller and you can see there's empty space here."" Image Credit: Screenshot/ YouTube 
He just couldn't stop talking about it, adding that if they were covering a Trump rally, the room would be โ€packed.โ€ 
Though Shapiro took a dig at the Democratic nominee for her apparently โ€emptyโ€ rally, those who were in attendance still sang โ€Happy Birthdayโ€ to her. ",1
89,11 Fiction Podcasts Worth a Listen - The New York Times,Amanda Hess,"The fiction podcast is having a moment. But modern audio dramatists have been turning out intriguing scripted podcasts for several years, and theyโ€re showing no signs of slowing down. Take a guided tour through the past, present and future of audio drama with these fictional standouts. โ€The Truthโ€ bills itself as โ€movies for your ears. โ€ This anthology series, which tells stories through subtle sound effects and naturalistic acting, was ahead of its time at its 2012 debut. Typically, each episode places new characters into short capsule tales. But recently โ€The Truthโ€ introduced an   series, โ€Songonauts,โ€ about musicians in a struggling band who are unexpectedly transported into their own songs. Listen here. โ€Welcome to Night Vale,โ€ which also began in 2012, takes the form of a darkly funny radio show, broadcast from a town where every conspiracy theory is true. Its   vibe  โ€”   just a narrator, a script and some music  โ€”   is matched by its bizarre storytelling form. At first, listening to โ€Welcome to Night Valeโ€ feels like tuning into a disoriented beat poetry session, but with every episode, listeners get drawn closer into this community, its characters and their strange dealings. Listen here. โ€Limetownโ€ is a 2015 podcast that follows the story of a radio reporter with American Public Radio, who sets out to solve the sudden and mysterious disappearance of 300 people in a Tennessee town. Though itโ€s one of several fictional podcasts released last year to borrow the aesthetics of the   podcast โ€Serial,โ€ this one is still an exciting debut from   Productions, an upstart fiction podcast studio thatโ€s poised to expand with a slate of scripted series next year. Listen here. โ€The Messageโ€ is the first fiction series to come out of a partnership between the   podcast network Panoply and the sponsor, General Electric. The collaboration is branded G. E. Podcast Theater, harking back to the old, Ronald   radio and television anthology series General Electric Theater. โ€The Messageโ€ felt more moneyed than many of early fiction podcasts, boasting cinematic sound design and a tense plot that felt borrowed from peak TV, and it was rewarded with a No. 1 slot on the iTunes charts last year. Listen here. โ€Alice Isnโ€t Dead,โ€ a haunting new tale from the creators of โ€Welcome to Night Vale,โ€ was released earlier this year under their new podcast imprint, Night Vale Presents. โ€Alice Isnโ€t Deadโ€ follows a woman as she sets out on a frightening and fantastical road trip in an effort to track down her missing wife.

90,Mike Birbigliaโ€s 6 Tips for Making It Small in Hollywood. Or Anywhere. - The New York Times,Mike Birbiglia,"This summer, I went on a   tour with my movie โ€Donโ€t Think Twice,โ€ a comedy about an improv group that has to decide whether to stay in show business when one member is plucked for a โ€Saturday Night Liveโ€ type of show. At every Q. and A. session for the movie, people would ask the same question: โ€If I want to be a comedian [or actor or writer or improviser or film director] how do I get started?โ€ The truth is they should probably pick someone more successful to ask  โ€”   I make small films, small   shows Off Broadway and small comedy specials for Netflix  โ€”   but Iโ€m the person who showed up to talk to them. And now Iโ€m the person offering you unsolicited advice  โ€”   so if you donโ€t need it or want it, this is not for you. Anyway, Iโ€ve boiled my answer down to six ideas. 1. DONโ€T WAIT Write. Make a short film. Go to an open mike. Take an improv class. Thereโ€s no substitute for actually doing something. Donโ€t talk about it anymore. Maybe donโ€t even finish reading this essay. 2. FAIL Donโ€t worry about failing. Thereโ€s a great video where Ira Glass explains that when you start in a new field, your work wonโ€t be as good as your taste. It will take years for your taste and the quality of your work to intersect. (If ever!) Failure is essential. Thereโ€s no substitute for it. Itโ€s not just encouraged but required. The bedrock of all good pieces of writing is 10 bad drafts. Maybe 20. I wrote 12 drafts of โ€Donโ€t Think Twice,โ€ 14 drafts of my first movie, โ€Sleepwalk With Me,โ€ and worked on my first   show for six years. My first   set on โ€Late Show With David Lettermanโ€ in 2002 was mined from three hours of   material that I had tried and failed with for six years. 3. LEARN FROM THE FAILURE This is where it becomes important to find a community of people you respect. People who have good taste. People who might not be good at something themselves but know what good is. They might be in a theater company, at an improv school, or live in your dorm. They arenโ€t the easiest thing to find. When I was in college, every Wednesday I drove my girlfriend Maggieโ€s Ford Taurus to an open mike at a Best Western 40 minutes away, to enter a lottery of 30 comedians trying to win one of the nine spots to perform in front of the other angry 21 comedians. It sucked. People didnโ€t like my comedy there. I didnโ€t love theirs. It wasnโ€t a fit. But then I got a job working as a door person at the DC Improv comedy club in Washington, and that was a fit. Around the same time, I was cast in my college improv group. So all at once, I met people whom I could bounce jokes and ideas off of. Theyโ€d give me candid feedback, and I tried to listen. I wasnโ€t great at it at first. Itโ€s hard to hear criticism. But Iโ€ve learned that harsh feedback, constructive feedback, even weird, random feedback, is all helpful, if you know the essence of what youโ€re trying to convey. I once heard an interview where Ron Howard said that he tests the rough cuts of his movies with a ton of audiences. He doesnโ€t do it to be told what the movieโ€s vision should be, but to understand whether his vision is coming across. If not, he makes changes. Your vision is not being conveyed a majority of the time. With โ€Donโ€t Think Twice,โ€ I workshopped the script like the way I workshop my standup: I invited friends over to read it out loud in my living room and then fed them pizza. The pizza was excellent. The script often wasnโ€t. So Iโ€d get my friends all drunk on pizza and then ask them hard questions like: โ€What do you like least about the script? Be honest. I can take it. โ€ Thatโ€s where I learned the most. 4. MAYBE QUIT You might not be meant to be a writer or performer or improviser. You might be meant to teach kids math or raise money for a food bank or start a company that makes Rubikโ€s Cubes for babies. Donโ€t rule out quitting. There is going to be an insane amount of work ahead, and your time might be spent better elsewhere. There was a great column in The New York Times recently where Angela Duckworth writes, โ€Rather than ask, โ€What do I want to be when I grow up?โ€ ask, โ€In what way do I wish the world were different? What problem can I help solve?โ€ This puts the focus where it should be  โ€”   on how you can serve other people. โ€ 5. BE BOLD ENOUGH TO MAKE STUFF THATโ€S SMALL BUT GREAT Eight years ago, I made a network sitcom pilot based on my life. It was a dream come true. A sitcom about my life? What could be better than that for a standup comedian? Well, it didnโ€t get picked up. I was devastated. But hereโ€s the kicker: Failing to get that sitcom was the single greatest stroke of luck thatโ€s happened in my entire career. The show wasnโ€t truly my comedic voice. It was watered down by network and studio notes to the point of being like dozens of other bland sitcoms. After that, I no longer wanted to create projects for the Hollywood gatekeepers. The networks. The studios. Since then, Iโ€ve created a handful of pieces for โ€This American Life,โ€   three Off Broadway   shows, toured hundreds of cities around the world, and written, directed and starred in two feature films. All outside the system. Based on that work, Iโ€ve been offered small movie roles by people who work inside the system. Which is to say: Leaving the system behind and creating something of your own may actually be thing that gets you into the system, hopefully on your own terms. The point is, forget the gatekeepers. As far as Iโ€m concerned, what you create in a       improv theater in Phoenix can be far more meaningful than a mediocre sitcom being   by seven million people. America doesnโ€t need more stuff. We need more great stuff. You could make that. 6. CLEVERNESS IS OVERRATED, AND HEART IS UNDERRATED Plus, there are fewer people competing for heart, so you have a better chance of getting noticed. Sometimes people say, โ€One thing you have to offer in your work is yourself. โ€ I disagree. I think itโ€s the only thing.",0
91,Investment Strategist Forecasts Collapse Timeline: โ€The Last Gasp Of This Economic Cycle Will Come In 2018โ€,Mac Slavo,"It is no longer a question of whether or not financial markets and the U.S. economy will collapse. That, according to a host of experts, both mainstream and alternative, is a given. 
The only question now is โ€whenโ€ that moment will come. 
According to Christine Hughes, chief investment strategist at Otterwood Capital , it will be very soon. Basing her assessment on historically dead-on yield curve analysis, Hughes says in her latest update to clients that weโ€re looking at a maximum breaking point of 2020, but that some time in the next 12 โ€“ 15 months is the more likely scenario, which pegs the next crisis right at the beginning of 2018 . 
First, the chart, which has been near perfect in its accuracy thus far and shows just how rapidly the yield curve has collapsed in the last 12 months: 
Hughes explains what it means for you and why you can expect 2018 to be the year of reckoning: 
As the bond market sees a recession slower growth means lower interest rates and it [the yield curve] collapses. So letโ€s assume weโ€re like every other time in history and that happens. Then it moves forward to 2018โ€ฆ 
So, 2018, according to the yield curve, is pretty much the last gasp we have for this economic cycle. Weโ€re closing in on 2016 nowโ€ฆ we basically have a yearโ€ฆ maybe a year to 15 months before we have the next crisis on our hands. 
So if you are levered personally or corporatelyโ€ฆ if a lot of your assets are in illiquid stuffโ€ฆ the Canadian housing market comes to mindโ€ฆ You might want to think about existing and liquefying yourself. 
Watch the video report: 
Wolf Richter of Wolf Street explains why the Treasury Yield Curve is so important: 
Since early July, the 30-year US Treasury Bond Price Index has plunged 8.3%. Itโ€s now called โ€the routโ€ in longer-dated government bonds. One of the specters is rising inflation at a time of ultra-low yields. 
What has become the number one predictor of a bear market in stocks over the past many decades? The US Treasury yield curve. It drives bank lending โ€“ which can strangle the economy. But this time, the risks are much higher, and the potential economic consequences steeper. 
We know it is only a matter of time at this point. 
Greg Mannarino of Traders Choice has made similar warnings, noting that the bond markets are signaling a massive crash ahead. And when that crash finally takes place the fall out after the debt bubble bursts, according to Mannarino, could lead to extremely serious consequences: 
So, when the debt bubble bursts weโ€re going to get a correction in population. Itโ€s a mathematical certainty. 
Millions upon millions of people are going to die on a world-wide scale when the debt bubble bursts. And Iโ€m saying when not ifโ€ฆ 
โ€ฆ 
When resources become more and more scarce weโ€re going to see countries at war with each other. People will be scramblingโ€ฆ in a worst case scenarioโ€ฆ doing everything that they can to surviveโ€ฆ to provide for their family and for themselves. 
Thereโ€s no way out of it. 
If Mannarino and Hughes are right, you have about a year to get ready for the next leg of the collapse .

92,"Venezuela Muzzles Legislature, Moving Closer to One-Man Rule - The New York Times",Nicholas Casey and Patricia Torres,"IQUITOS, Peru  โ€”   Venezuela took its strongest step yet toward   rule under the leftist President Nicolรกs Maduro as his loyalists on the Supreme Court seized power from the National Assembly in a ruling late Wednesday night. The ruling effectively dissolved the elected legislature, which is led by Mr. Maduroโ€s opponents, and allows the court to write laws itself, experts said. The move caps a year in which the last vestiges of Venezuelaโ€s democracy have been torn down, critics and regional leaders say, leaving what many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime, but an outright dictatorship. โ€What we have warned of has finally come to pass,โ€ said Luis Almagro, the head of the Organization of American States, a regional diplomacy group that includes Venezuela and is investigating the country for violating the blocโ€s Democratic Charter. Mr. Almagro called the move a โ€  coup,โ€ a term used in Latin America to denote takeovers typical of the 1990s in Guatemala and Peru  โ€”   but virtually   in the region today. Recent months have seen a swift consolidation of power by Mr. Maduro as scores of political prisoners have been detained without trial, protesters violently repressed and local elections postponed. In taking power from the National Assembly, the ruling removed what most consider to be the only remaining counterbalance to the presidentโ€s growing power in the country. The court said that lawmakers were โ€in a situation of contempt,โ€ and that while that lasted, the justices themselves would step in to โ€ensure that parliamentary powers were exercised directly by this chamber, or by the body that the chamber chooses. โ€ It did not say whether it might hand power back. Members of the National Assembly denounced the ruling on Thursday. โ€They have kidnapped the Constitution, they have kidnapped our rights, they have kidnapped our liberty,โ€ said Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the body, holding a crumpled copy of the ruling before reporters on Thursday. Oneida Guaipe, an opposition lawmaker from the countryโ€s central coast, said the body would continue to do its work, even if its laws would now be ignored when it produced legislation. โ€This is demonstrating before the world the authoritarianism here,โ€ she said. โ€The people chose us through a popular vote. โ€ The ruling was also a challenge to Venezuelaโ€s neighbors, which met in Washington this week to put pressure on the country to hold elections, and to discuss a possible expulsion of Venezuela from the O. A. S. on the grounds that the country is not democratic. Last week, the United States, Canada and a dozen of Latin Americaโ€s largest nations called for Mr. Maduro to recognize the National Assemblyโ€s powers, a rare joint statement that reflected deep impatience with his government. โ€We consider it a serious setback for democracy in Venezuela,โ€ the United States State Department said on Thursday of the court decision. Peru withdrew its ambassador in protest. David Smilde, an analyst from the Washington Office on Latin America, a human rights advocacy group, said it might now be up to Venezuelaโ€s neighbors to encourage the country to hold elections again, given resistance from within the government. โ€The Maduro government seems to have no intention of respecting the basic elements of electoral democracy,โ€ he said. Critics say a long litany of other moves by the government are taking a toll on Venezuelaโ€s democracy. Perhaps most visible to Venezuelans was an effort last year to hold a recall referendum against the president, whose popularity is sinking along with the countryโ€s collapsing economy. While such a referendum was permitted by the countryโ€s Constitution, and highly favored in polls, Mr. Maduro alternatively called the effort illegal or a coup staged by his opponents. In October, a lower court suspended the process on the grounds that there had been irregularities in the gathering of signatures. Meanwhile, political prisoners continued to be arrested. In January, Mr. Maduro established a new โ€  commandoโ€ to round up political dissidents accused of treason. The group has taken aim at members of the opposition, arresting many, including a city councilman from central Venezuela and a deputy lawmaker in the National Assembly. In February, after CNN en Espaรฑol, the networkโ€s Spanish language channel, broadcast an investigation that linked Venezuelaโ€s vice president to a passport fraud scheme in the Middle East, Mr. Maduro ordered the channel off the air. The government has blocked the Caracas bureau chief of The New York Times from entering the country since October. But to many, the gradual assault against the National Assembly, more than a year in the making, was the most telling sign of democratic erosion in Venezuela. โ€It has come in fragments,โ€ Carlos Ayala Corao, a Venezuelan lawyer and legal analyst, said of the courtโ€s actions against the legislature. โ€They have been slicing it in pieces. โ€ The conflicts began in December 2015, when rising grievances about the countryโ€s faltering economy propelled Mr. Maduroโ€s opposition to win control of the legislature. It was the first time in years that the chamber was not dominated by the movement founded by the former leftist President Hugo Chรกvez. Mr. Maduro initially said he accepted the vote. He even appeared before opposition lawmakers to give his annual address on the state of the government in January of last year. But the Supreme Court, packed with loyalists to Mr. Maduro shortly before the National Assembly took power, was chipping away at the chamberโ€s powers. It refused to let it seat four lawmakers on the grounds that there had been voting irregularities. That denied the opposition of a supermajority, which would have given it expanded powers over Mr. Maduro. The National Assembly went back and forth on the ruling, but eventually complied. As the National Assembly began to get to work, it continued to clash with the court. By last spring, the legislature had written laws delivering on campaign promises like one measure to invigorate the economy and another to free more than 100 political prisoners, only to see the court overturn them as unconstitutional. When Mr. Maduro tried to increase his own powers under a state of emergency that he declared, the legislature rejected the effort. But the court sided with the president. In October, the court stripped the National Assembly of its power to review the annual budget, leaving Mr. Maduro in charge of the countryโ€s purse strings. More recently, legislators tried to block the president from pursuing oil ventures without their approval. In Wednesdayโ€s ruling stripping the National Assembly of its lawmaking powers, the court said the president had the right to make these oil deals. It said its ruling was justified by the Assemblyโ€s choice to keep the lawmakers onboard whose elections had been questioned earlier. This act, it said, rendered the Assembly itself invalid. With few protesters in the streets of Caracas on Thursday, it was unclear what popular support the opposition might get from the public. Analysts say many Venezuelans feel as dispirited by the opposition as by leftist leaders, given the oppositionโ€s continued defeat by the government. Opposition leaders called for protests on Saturday and in the coming week but have been unable to draw large crowds since last fall. John Magdaleno, a political consultant, said he expected a wider crackdown against the opposition from Mr. Maduro in coming weeks, and possibly more arrests. โ€In my opinion, from now on, there will be growing pressures against lawmakers,โ€ he said, โ€and itโ€s probable there will be much greater persecution of political leaders. โ€",0
93,"Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate",Natural News Editors,"Whether it's John McCain, Mitt Romney or Donald Trump, Democrats always run 'War on Women' tactic to destroy the Republican candidate 
  Natural News Editors Tags: war on women , democrats , campaign tactic (NaturalNews) Single women are a crucial element of the Democrat constituency, pushed to the polls with a crude combination of scare tactics and pandering that would be comical if it wasn't so effective in election after election. We may pause to remark that Republicans should have been much more prepared for this in 2016, but we should also look back to 2012 because it was used in 2012, regardless of how absurd it was to suggest Mitt Romney was leading a ""War on Women.""(Article written by John Howard, republished from Breitbart.com )Even some liberals are recognizing the absurdity, given the emergence of ""Strange New Respect"" for Romney this year. Of course this new respect is pure political opportunism โ€” and don't be surprised to hear liberals complaining in future election that the conservative Republican presidential candidate isn't as candid and relaxed about social issues as Donald Trump was in the good old days of 2016.We should practice a little political opportunism of our own, and put the Left's revised opinion of Romney to good use. What they said about him was absurd in almost every respect. They've wholeheartedly embraced his position on the geopolitical threat of Russia, which means they're tacitly admitting Barack Obama didn't know what the hell he was talking about. They razz Trump about not paying enough taxes, but they didn't care a whit that Romney paid stupendous amounts of tax, plus vast charitable contributions.Most pertinently, they turned Mitt Romney into a misogynist clod, and his wife Ann Romney into an out-of-touch Stepford Wife, on the thinnest of pretexts. Lefty polemicists today are acting like they were possessed by political demons when they spent the final weeks of the 2012 campaign shrieking about ""binders full of women ,"" and now they can't quite remember what they were going on about.As for Mrs. Romney, she was unceremoniously stripped of her feminine identity by liberals and treated like a space alien because she dared to endorse stay-at-home motherhood. When a mild backlash ensued, the White House memorably denied one of its slander ninja by claiming to know several different people with the same name. [1, 2]In the Democrat imagination and campaign ads, Republicans are constantly targeting American woman. You can draw a straight line from Anita Hill's hit on Clarence Thomas in the Nineties, to ""journalist"" George Stephanopoulos ambushing the Republican presidential field with a bizarre question about contraceptives in the 2012 primary.It's all pure opportunism, not principle. Romney was a choirboy, so they claimed his policies revealed his secret inner misogynist beast. Trump's policies include a family-leave plan, a culture-war cease-fire declared by Peter Thiel at the GOP convention, and an unease with late-term abortion that tracks with the majority of the country. There's precious little that could be twisted into a War on Women narrative, even by the people who used Sandra Fluke to portray spending ten bucks on contraceptives as the equivalent of female slavery. Therefore, the Left ignores Trump's policies and hits his character, while Bill Freakin' Clinton gets ready to move back into the White House.In the Nineties, Democrats argued that Clinton's sexual abuses had nothing to do with how he governed, so discussing them was a silly distraction we all needed to MoveOn.org from, even when he was in the dock for perjury. Liberals of that election cycle laughed out loud at the notion Bill Clinton's libido had any effect whatsoever on national policy. He was good for the abortion industry, so his treatment of actual women was irrelevant.Partisan feminism is at a strange crossroads, as the core feminist message of independence clashes with victim politics. Women are supposed to simultaneously feel strong, capable... and be utterly helpless before systemic male chauvinism. They can only achieve personal ""independence"" through total dependence on the Big Government, which is staffed and managed by the only men in America who supposedly aren't looking to exploit them. (You're not to think about the bureaucrats who keep getting caught surfing for pornography on government computers.) [3]The great left-wing project to rewire society in defiance of biology has saddled America with devastating social problems, but that's not a problem for the social engineers. Indeed, it's more of a feature than a bug.Everything from illegitimacy, to crime, to the enormous difficulty of raising children as a single mom becomes another opportunity for them to push increased government power on a fearful, atomized population, which is rapidly losing its ability to form non-government voluntary structures of enduring social value, such as thriving small businesses and stable marriages.The dirty little secret known to the Left all along, but denied vociferously by them until their plans were fully up and running, is that most of these societal changes hit women harder, due to everything from their voluntary career choices, to the realities of child-rearing.So in the world liberals have made, single women become more anxious than ever, about everything from campus rape to the ""implicit bias"" of a systematically misogynist workplace, and they rush to government for protection from the harms caused by that abusive government.Read more at: Breitbart.com",1

95,White House Confirms More Gitmo Transfers Before Obama Leaves Office,Edwin Mora,"President Barack Obama will likely release more prisoners from the U. S. military prison in Guantรกnamo Bay, Cuba, before incoming    Donald Trump takes over on January 20, the White House press secretary reiterated on Thursday. [That same day, reports confirmed that the U. S. transferred four detainees to Saudi Arabia.  The Daily Mail has placed the number of 11th hour transfers at 22, including the four recently sent to Saudi Arabia, adding that the group of prisoners who are expected to be released will include jihadists who have threatened to behead and bomb Americans. Prior to the Daily Mail article and recent transfers, the number of prisoners who are expected to be set free by the time Obama leaves the White House varied by news agencies, ranging from 17 to 19, a move that would reduce the current detainee population at the Guantรกnamo facility to between 40 and 42. On Thursday, Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman, told reporters: I am not able to speak to any specific detainee transfers between now and January 20th other than to confirm for you that there are likely to be some.  And whenever those transfers take place, once they have been completed, we announce them publicly.  And that will continue to be our approach through January 20th.  And my expectation is that there will be some additional announcements of that type. Asked about the risk of detainees   in terrorist activity against the United States, Earnest boasted that only nine of the prisoners transferred since Obama took office have been confirmed by the intelligence community as having returned to militant activity, compared to 21 percent (113 of 532) under the previous administration, a figure often touted by Democrats. However, Earnest failed to mention that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) figure (nine) that he highlights refers to   as of July 2016, when 161 detainees had been released by Obama, not the 183 he mentioned on Thursday. The nine confirmed   includes one deceased detainee and accounts for six percent of the 161 prisoners who had been released under Obama as of July 2016. Moreover, the number of prisoners released before 2009 exceeds those liberated under Obama more than   (3. 3) which may account for the higher rate of confirmed   under George W. Bush. The White House spokesman attributed the low percentage of   under Obama to the presidentโ€s     panel, known as the Periodic Review Board (PRB) that has cleared for release all the prisoners transferred out after 2009, including   โ€forever prisoners,โ€ or those believed to be too dangerous to release. โ€Since President Obama took office, and since these reforms were initiated, nine detainees have been confirmed by the intelligence community of reengaging in the fight,โ€ Earnest said on Thursday. โ€Considering that we have released 183 detainees during President Obamaโ€s time in office, a little     math would indicate that our percentage is much better, and itโ€s a result of the reforms that President Obama instituted on his first day in office. โ€ According to ODNI, 20 out of 161 detainees (12 percent) had been confirmed (nine) or suspected (11) to have returned to terrorist activities under Obamaโ€s watch as of July 2016. Under the Bush administration, 188 out of 532 (35 percent) are confirmed (113) or suspected (75) to have   in terrorism. When taken as a whole, if there were 20 detainees confirmed or suspected to have   in terrorism for every 161 detainees released under Bush like during the Obama administration, the overall rate of terror returnees before 2009 would be closer to 40 percent, not 35. In late December, the Chicago Tribune, citing U. S. officials, reported that the Obama administration has shared its plans with Congress to transfer out as many as 19 detainees held at Guantรกnamo Bay, Cuba. Of the 55 prisoners still held at Gitmo, 18 have been cleared for release by Obamaโ€s PRB and more than half (27) are considered โ€forever prisoners,โ€ or too dangerous to release. Nevertheless, Obama has already released prisoners who had been designated too dangerous to release. The remaining 10 prisoners are believed to still be undergoing war crimes proceedings at military commissions, including at least six who were facing death penalty tribunals as of late last year. On Friday, the Pentagon announced that four detainees  โ€”   Salem Ahmad Hadi Bin Kanad, Muhammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanim, Abdallah Yahya Yusif   and Muhammad Ali Abdallah Muhammad Bwazir  โ€”   had been transferred to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. All four detainees are from   Yemen, which shares a border with Saudi Arabia. At least two individuals  โ€”   Kanad and Ghanim  โ€”   had been linked to the Taliban when they were apprehended and taken to the Guantรกnamo prison, also known as Gitmo. Meanwhile, the    Bwazir has been directly linked to Osama bin Laden.   also affiliated with   was born in Saudi Arabia, but is a citizen of Yemen, according to the U. S. military. In December 2007, the U. S. military deemed him โ€a HIGH risk, as he is likely to pose a threat to the US, its interests and allies. โ€",0
96,The Geometry of Energy and Meditation of Buddha,nan,"License DMCA 
A mandala is a visual symbol often utilized in meditation practices and teachings. The mandala symbol itself is a geometric construction of points, lines, planes and solids symbolizing the universe. Mandalas are geometric designs depictive of the universe specifically. Other designs are similarly meditation tools, but may not be mandalas specifically. The visually conceived geometric symbols are visual meditation tools. A visual meditation tool is called a yantra. Mandalas and all other yantras are visual meditation points of concentration. Yantras are visual meditative tools similar in value to points of concentration. The image above is the sri yantra, sri meaning king or most important. 
A mantra is the audio version of a mandala. A mantra is an audio meditation tool. Whether the sound of the mantra is a single syllable tone or a series of lengthy metaphysical musings, a mantra is an audio meditation tool. Mantras, as sound vibration, are wavy linear vibrations of connection. 
The terms asana and mudra both reference physical positioning. An asana is a body posture as a meditation tool, and a mudra is a hand gesture or posture as a meditation tool. Asanas and mudras enable our own bodies to become a geometric representation of a meditation tool. The postures are physical meditation tools transforming self into one's own geometric figure or plane among the space and sensitive to the space of self and surroundings. 
Tantra means unification, or looming/weaving together principles and practices, instruction and individual action. Tantra unites entirety. Tantra signifies confluence and integration; a fusion. It is Sanskrit for loom, the device which weaves together string into cloth. It is an ancient word with many properties and has been variously used to describe the knots of strings weaved together in a rug, and the cord on which sacred mala bead necklaces were strung, (Mala beads are Tibetan prayer necklaces of 108 beads used to assist mentally or vocally repeating a mantra 108 times.) and practices of unification of individual with the universal. Today the word tantra is often used in reference to the union of lovemaking. Though there is also a specific type of yoga called Tantra Yoga it means unification. 
There is the potentiation of the unification of principle and practice. There is the potentiation of tantra of yantra, mantra and asana. And there is certainly the lesson of the potentiation of Yin Yang tantra. The combination of Yin and Yang potentials and energies within leads to all sorts of aspects of development. This can be energetically understood in the idea that there are only two types of energies, straight and circular, straight for Yang potentials and circular for Yin potentials. It can be understood on a tangible level that rest and work are both required. When straight and circular energies combine, a spiral results. A spiral is one of, if not the highest expressions of energy. 
More broadly and generally, tantra notes a mutually accepted connection, a tied knot of intertwined being, like lovemaking, but not necessarily beginning with or limited to the act of lovemaking. Humanity itself is a tantra; a fused weaving knot or many strings, of many instructions and many individuals. - Advertisement - 
Essentially tantra is spiritual understanding of the relationship and connections between individuation and universal energies. An ancient spiritual philosophy preceding both Buddhism and Hinduism, tantra represents integration, unifying the macrocosm with the microcosm, the universal and the individual, the feminine and the masculine, the Yin and the Yang. It also refers to integrative knowledge and its continuation and building refinement through the interaction of teacher and student, signifying union and fusion; the acceptance, integration and transmutation of knowledge between individuals, like the string of life. 
Tantric ideas enhance and explore metaphysical merging of ideas and energies. Tantra is the merging of the physical and spiritual, through the merging of the conceptual. In essence, Tantra is the integration of yantra (the philosophy of visual symbols), mantra (communication of audio symbolism) and mudra (our very physical posturing) each of which is important on their own and increasing so when intertwined aspects of yoga, and life. Tantra unites meditation practices and enhances the individual unity expansion with entirety of the universal. 
There is not necessarily the need for a specific yantra, or specific mantra, or specific asana in meditation, however each are tools that can be used and considered, and most are most powerful when practiced in unified tantric manner, or tantric mind state. A tantric mind state recognizes unity expansion and aims toward it, rather than cultivating a mind state of separation. 
No matter how one approaches meditation the unifying tantra of our meditation principles and practices bring about the unity expansion of yantra no matter. No matter our level of refinement of posture, we are always in an asana, no matter if we utilize mantra, or yantra, we for th most part still see and hear and those who cannot can still concentrate and connect. And no matter the mantra, yantra or asana, it is the principles behind and pertaining to the symbolism that contains the real power, the highest potential for tantric connection. Yantras, mantras and asanas establish your sacred space and sacred perimeter and uniting with entirety in tantric balance. 
Seed of Buddha Meditation - Advertisement - 
One of my favorite meditations relates to the four dimensions of geometry, but is extracted from Buddhist lessons. It is one of the most powerful meditations I have learned and as I learned it, Buddha himself practiced and taught this meditation. I learned this meditation from a Tibetan Buddhist monk from Nepal before I considered the four dimensions of geometry applied to meditation. On later examination however the components of the meditation relate to the four dimensions of geometry. 
This meditation is direct and simple, but can lead to infinitely complex profound lessons. The profundity of each of the ideas in this meditation cannot be understated. And each of the concepts has been elaborated on endlessly for centuries since Buddha, and so the presentation here is of course a simplification of the ideas and processes that might be endlessly explored and refined. And that is what meditation is all about really, our own personal inward exploration and refinement. 
To begin, sit in a comfortable cross legged position on a meditation pillow. Sit for a time to simply settle into absorption and relaxation, focusing on the breath. The rhythm of the following meditation consists of mindfulness of an idea followed by mindfulness of no idea, where as much as possible we think on nothingness. The nothingness gives us a chance to relax, compared to processing the series of ideas which can all be quite intense. The process can be done in any time period. The point is to cover each idea as deeply as can be, given time or mental state circumstances. 
The meditation is formed from important Buddhist concepts. Many meditations are derived from such teachings, Buddhist and otherwise, so that there are lessons in a sense for the secular, and meditation practitioners.",1
97,Poll: Most Voters Have Not Heard of Democratic 2020 Election Candidates - Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,"There is a minefield of potential 2020 election candidates in the Democratic Party waiting to challenge President Trump, but most voters have not heard of many of them, according to a new poll. [The   Consult poll asked 1, 990 registered voters their views on 19 potential Democratic challengers to Trumpโ€s presidency.  The list of potential candidates identified in the survey includes eight senators, five governors, a mayor of a large city, a congressman, two CEOs, a former vice president, and a failed Senate candidate. Of those mentioned in the survey, half of the respondents did not know most of the candidates. โ€All bets are off when it comes to the composition of the 2020 Democratic primary,โ€ said Morning Consult   and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. โ€This early polling indicates that many of the names being floated in Washington still have a lot of work to do in terms of building national profiles. โ€ Most survey respondents were able to identify and have opinions on former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ( ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ).   of the voters surveyed said they knew enough about Biden and Warren to have formed opinions about the candidates. Sanders was not included in the survey. According to Morning Consult, Biden was the most popular candidate of the list of potential 2020 Democratic candidates, with 74 percent of respondents having a positive view of the former vice president. Warren came in second, with 51 percent of respondents viewing her favorably. The number of those rumored to be potential Democratic candidates for the 2020 election pales in comparison to the list of people who have filed to run for president so   129 people have filed to run for the presidency in 2020.",0
98,Migrants Confront Judgment Day Over Old Deportation Orders - The New York Times,Vivian Yee,"There are a little more than two weeks between Juan, an electrician in the Bronx, and the date he cannot forget: March 21, 2017, at 8 a. m. when the federal government has told him to report for deportation. Two weeks to decide: Avoid it, and try to preserve the American life he has built for a little longer, even as a fugitive. Go, and lose it all: his wife and son, his job, his apartment, his world. โ€I would feel like an animal if I stay here and hide,โ€ said Juan, 29, who asked that his last name not be used. โ€I want to prove that I can follow the laws. I want to make my case at this meeting, but I know that if I go, theyโ€re going to deport me. โ€ In an immigration system mottled with escape hatches and hobbled by scant resources, Juan, who fled Colombia six years ago, is one of nearly a million people who have managed to linger in the United States despite having been ordered out of the country by an immigration judge  โ€”   some of them more than a decade ago. And with the Trump administration intent on sweeping perhaps millions of immigrants without legal status out of the country, the White House has not had to look far to make a quick mark. Because people with deportation orders have had their day in court, most of them can be sent out of the country without seeing a judge, sometimes within hours of being arrested. โ€People who have been ordered deported and who are still here are the   fruit,โ€ said Stephen   an immigration law professor at Cornell University. โ€Trump has said he has wanted to deport more people. The easiest way to get those numbers up are to take those people whoโ€ve been ordered deported and go after them. โ€ President Trumpโ€s immigration agency has already offered what looks like a preview: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents recently deported to Mexico an Arizona  mother who had been ordered out of the country four years ago. But the   will be complicated. The backlog of what the government calls โ€fugitive aliensโ€ has persisted through Republican and Democratic administrations, inflamed conservatives who oppose illegal immigration, and resisted the immigration authoritiesโ€ attempts at enforcement. Since 2006, even as the overall total of unauthorized immigrants in the United States has dipped, the number facing outstanding deportation orders has grown by more than half, to around 962, 000 people from 632, 726. More than half of them come from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. (Another 13, 200 or so, as of early February, were already in the custody of customs officials.) Despite the Bush and Obama administrationsโ€   commitments to focus on expelling those who pose a serious danger to their communities, slightly less than one in five people facing deportation has been convicted of a crime in the United States. The causes for delays can vary. Deportations have been deferred for humanitarian reasons  โ€”   like allowing mothers to stay with sick children in the United States  โ€”   or they have been frozen while an appeal is mounted. The Obama administration put off deportations for thousands of immigrants it did not consider priorities, including Juan, the Bronx electrician, and Guadalupe Garcรญa de Rayos, the Arizona mother, often   people with strong ties to their communities. โ€Felons, not families criminals, not children,โ€ President Barack Obama said in 2014, describing the kinds of people he wanted deported. The government also postponed deportations for people who were likely to face torture if they were sent back. Some deportations are simply impossible to carry out: About a quarter of the immigrants with outstanding deportation orders come from countries that refuse to take back deportees, including China, Haiti, Brazil and India. Mr. Trump has threatened to stop issuing visas to people from these countries. In the past, diplomats have urged caution on this front, not wanting to disrupt international relationships over the issue of deportees. And many people under final orders have slipped through gaping cracks in the immigration system. Court notices  โ€”   either mailed to outdated addresses or illegible to Spanish speakers  โ€”   are routinely missed, leaving judges to issue deportation orders for people who miss their chance to argue their case. Nearly a quarter of judgesโ€ decisions rendered in 2015, for example, involved cases where the immigrant in question was absent. The months and, sometimes, years it takes for immigration and asylum cases to wind through a clogged court system can cause the authorities to lose track of immigrants living and working in the country, because they have fled or simply moved. The White House has sought to make it harder for immigrants to be remain free inside the United States while their requests for asylum plod through the courts. They will be detained more often, or asked to wait in Mexico until a judge can rule. โ€There are all kinds of things in the system that werenโ€t built to maximize compliance,โ€ said David A. Martin, a professor of immigration law at the University of Virginia and a former immigration official in the Obama and Clinton administrations. It led to a climate, he said, that has prompted many people to not consider a deportation order a serious matter. โ€And thatโ€s one of the attitudes that sometimes infuriates, with some justification, people who voted for Donald Trump. โ€ In a significant break from his predecessor, Mr. Trump is directing immigration agents to go after virtually anyone who is in the United States illegally, ending the reprieve for people who had not been considered priorities. โ€Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed,โ€ one line of Mr. Trumpโ€s executive order on immigration reads, with the crispness of a traffic sign. โ€What has been lacking, up until a month ago, is a willingness and a commitment on the part of the administration to actually do it,โ€ said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter immigration controls. โ€Nothing is easy,โ€ he said, but going after people who already have deportation orders โ€will be the easiest part of enforcing the presidentโ€s removal priorities. โ€ President George W. Bushโ€s administration dented the backlog by deploying fugitive teams that were supposed to track down unauthorized immigrants with deportation orders and criminal records. But the strategy drew a backlash when the raids began snaring undocumented immigrants who were not targets. โ€That was something that caused a lot of controversy and a lot of anxiety in immigrant communities, because it meant these officers could stop anyone at any time,โ€ said Randy Capps, the director of research at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. Mr. Capps added that while the Obama administration narrowed the scope of such raids, he expected the Trump administration to return to the Bush model. There is, of course, an easier way to find some people with final orders: Wait for them to walk into ICE offices for their scheduled appointments. Ms. Rayos was driven across the border within hours of her   in Phoenix, and her deportation has haunted immigrants with coming appointments ever since. But the Trump administration has yet to show a consistent hand. Roxana Orellana Santos, 37, was allowed to walk out of her appointment in Baltimore last week. Ms. Santos, who said she had fled domestic abuse in El Salvador, was arrested in 2008 while eating lunch outdoors, her lawyers say, leading to a civil rights lawsuit that claimed she had been racially profiled. She had been ordered deported two years before that arrest, after she missed an immigration court hearing. Her lawyers said she could not read the notice, which was in English. Ms. Santosโ€s next appointment is in August. โ€I donโ€t feel assured of what the outcomeโ€s going to be next time,โ€ she said, adding that she had asked her brother to help her husband care for her four children if she was deported. In the case of Juan, the electrician, nothing remains to stop the government from acting on the deportation order he first received in 2013. Juan had requested asylum after paramilitary forces in Colombia tried to kill him, he said, but he lost his final appeal the month Mr. Trump was elected president. โ€I feel hopeless,โ€ Juan said. โ€My wife is here, my son is here, they are my world. I have nowhere else to run to. Iโ€ve run out of options. I donโ€t know what to do. โ€",0
99,"M.I.T., N.Y.U. and Yale Are Sued Over Retirement Plan Fees - The New York Times",Tara Siegel Bernard,"Three prominent universities were sued on Tuesday, accused of allowing their employees to be charged excessive fees on their retirement savings. The universities  โ€”   the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and Yale  โ€”   each have retirement plans holding more than $3 billion in assets and are being individually sued by a number of their employees in cases seeking   status. The lawyer representing the three groups of plaintiffs, Jerome J. Schlichter, is a pioneer in retirement plan litigation. Over the last decade, he has filed more than 20 lawsuits on behalf of workers in 401( k) retirement plans and has been widely credited with lowering plan fees across corporate America. With the suits filed in federal courts on Tuesday, the focus has turned to a   corner of the retirement savings market, 403( b) plans, which are named for a section of the tax code. The accounts are similar to 401( k) plans, but are offered by public schools and nonprofit institutions like universities and hospitals. The complaints allege that the universities, as the plan sponsors, failed to monitor excessive fees paid to administer the plans and did not replace more expensive,   investments with cheaper ones. Had the plans eliminated their long lists of investment options and used their bargaining power to cut costs, the complaints argue, participants could have collectively saved tens of millions of dollars. โ€It is important for retirees and employees of universities to have the same rights and ability to build their retirement assets as employees of   companies,โ€ said Mr. Schlichter, a founding partner of Schlichter Bogard  Denton in St. Louis. โ€They shouldnโ€t be penalized. โ€ In a statement, New York University said that it took the welfare of its faculty and employees seriously, including a dignified retirement. โ€The retirement plans offered to them are chosen and administered carefully and prudently. We will litigate this case vigorously and expect to prevail,โ€ said John Beckman, a university spokesman. A spokeswoman for M. I. T. said it did not comment on pending litigation, while Yale said it was โ€cautious and carefulโ€ in administering its plans and would defend itself vigorously. More attention is being paid to investment costs shouldered by American workers, who are less likely today to have pension plans. With the strong support of the Obama administration, the Labor Department introduced new rules in April to strengthen investor protections, requiring a broader group of financial professionals to act in customersโ€ best interest when handling their retirement money. The aim is to reduce conflicts of interest and the fees consumers pay. Even modest reductions in costs can have a significant effect on retireesโ€ savings. An   example from the Labor Department: Paying one percentage point more in fees over a   career  โ€”   say 1. 5 percent instead of 0. 5 percent  โ€”   could leave a worker with 28 percent less at retirement. An account with $25, 000  โ€”   and no further contributions for those 35 years  โ€”   would rise to only $163, 000 instead of $227, 000, at an annual rate of 7 percent. Mr. Schlichter said the three universitiesโ€ plans were targeted because more people were asking questions about their retirement accounts and โ€these involve clear breaches of the law. โ€ The complaint against N. Y. U.  โ€”   which involves two 403( b) plans covering faculty, research administration and the medical school  โ€”   centers largely on costs. The complaint said that participants were offered too many investment choices (there were more than 100 options for faculty) and that many of them were too expensive. The suit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, singles out several investments, including the TIAA Traditional Annuity, which it said has severe restrictions and penalties for withdrawal, as well as variable annuities that have several layers of fees and have historically underperformed. A spokesman for TIAA said it offered   plans and   investments that provide lifetime income. The suit also argues that even the cheapest funds offered could have been provided for less, given the enormous size and bargaining power of the faculty and medical school plans, which together held $4. 2 billion in assets for more than 24, 000 participants at the end of 2014. The complaint alleges that the university did not use its negotiating powers to select a single   record keeper for administrative tasks such as sending statements to employees. It said it also overpaid for these services for many years. The issues concerning Yaleโ€s 403( b) retirement plan  โ€”   which held nearly $3. 6 billion in assets in the spring of 2014  โ€”   follow a similar pattern: multiple record keepers with excessive fees, costing participants millions of dollars over the last six years too many investments of the same style and the use of   funds instead of identical but   ones. That case was filed in Federal District Court in Connecticut. Yale eventually consolidated to one provider, TIAA, in April 2015, and swapped in some   investments, but the suit claims that the changes did not go far enough to fully protect the interests of its employees. Mr. Schlichter said participants were still burdened with sorting through more than 100 options, many of which were too expensive. The complaints lodged against M. I. T. โ€s retirement plan (unusually, it is a 401( k) like those used by corporations) are similar but with a twist. The suit alleges that the university, because of its longstanding relationship with nearby Fidelity, did not conduct a thorough search for a plan provider, which might have provided better service for less. The retirement plan offered more than 340 investment options  โ€”   including 180 Fidelity funds  โ€”   until July 2015, when M. I. T. reduced the lineup to 37 options but still retained Fidelity as the record keeper. The complaint said that Fidelity had donated โ€hundreds of thousands of dollarsโ€ to M. I. T. while Abigail Johnson, Fidelityโ€s chief executive, has served as a member of M. I. T. โ€s board of trustees, giving her influence over the institutionโ€s  . Had the plan reduced its options to those on the menu it adopted last year, โ€participants would have saved over $8 million in fees in 2014 alone, and many millions more since 2010,โ€ according to the complaint, filed in Federal District Court in Massachusetts. M. I. T. recognized that the plan structure was inefficient, the filing said, since that was part of the reason it said it made the changes. But even after the overhaul, the suit alleges, investment costs could be further reduced. Fidelity, which noted that it was not a defendant in the case, declined to comment. Mr. Schlichterโ€s firm has settled about half of his 20 cases over the last 10 years. His first case involving a 403( b) was against Novant Health, a nonprofit hospital system, which settled last year for $32 million. In a landmark case he argued last year before the Supreme Court, the justices, in a unanimous decision, agreed that plan sponsors had a โ€continuing duty to monitor investments and remove imprudent ones. โ€ A series of suits, from Mr. Schlichterโ€s firm and others, continue to be filed in the corporate world: Several asset managers, including Neuberger Berman and Franklin Resources, among others, have recently been sued for putting their own investments in their employeesโ€ 401( k) plans. Some of the more prominent cases against 401( k) plans settled by Mr. Schlichter include a $62 million settlement against Lockheed Martin, $57 million from Boeing and $27. 5 million from Ameriprise, all in 2015. He also settled cases with Cigna, International Paper, Caterpillar, General Dynamics, Bechtel and Kraft. Mr. Schlichter said his firm, which works on a contingency basis, typically collects up to a third of the settlement, while the remainder goes to the plaintiffs and members of the class. He said that his settlements also required employers to make changes to their plans to ensure fees were reasonable in the future.",0

101,American Drivers Regain Appetite for Gas Guzzlers - The New York Times,Matt Richtel,"The single most effective action that most Americans can take to help reduce the dangerous emissions that cause climate change? Buy a more   car. But consumers are heading in the opposite direction. They have rekindled their love of bigger cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles, favoring them over small cars, hybrids and electric vehicles, which are considered crucial to helping slow global warming. So far this year, nearly 75 percent of the people who have traded in a hybrid or electric car to a dealer have replaced it with an   car, an 18 percent jump from 2015, according to Edmunds. com, a car shopping and research site. In 2008, President Obama set a goal of a million electric cars on the road by 2015 in the United States, but the total is now around 442, 000, including   hybrids. This year, electric and hybrid sales have dropped to 2. 4 percent of   purchases. Falling gas prices have made big, heavy cars fashionable again, said Michael Sivak, the director of sustainable worldwide transportation at the University of Michiganโ€s Transportation Research Institute. In fact, demand for trucks, S. U. V.s and vans has rebounded to historic levels after they dropped sharply in 2008, when gas was $4 a gallon. โ€People have very short memories about the price of gasoline,โ€ Dr. Sivak said. That spells trouble for the environment.     vehicles, including S. U. V.s and pickups as well as cars, account for 16. 2 percent of all greenhouse emissions produced in the United States, Dr. Sivakโ€s research shows, making them the biggest source of emissions that individuals control. Reducing tailpipe emissions โ€is perhaps the most important thing Americans can do,โ€ said Andrew Jones, a   of Climate Interactive, a think tank. โ€Weโ€re doing the opposite. โ€ The changing consumer patterns are in plain view at swapalease. com, a marketplace for people who want to get out of a car lease by transferring it to someone else. Dozens of hybrids and electric vehicles are available, in some cases languishing without bites from buyers. โ€Nobody is interested,โ€ said Angelo Di Maria, who lives in the Bronx. Several weeks ago, he listed his   โ€s 2013 Toyota Prius. To spur interest, he added a $1, 500 cash incentive, which sharply cut the monthly lease payment to $283 from $391. Still no buyer. Mr. Di Maria said that his    who works in construction, loved the Prius, but that his company had given him a Ford   pickup. โ€Who doesnโ€t want to drive around in a big tank?โ€ Mr. Di Maria said. โ€When people start to think gas is more affordable, do they really want to pay the premium on the hybrid?โ€ Buyers of electric cars enjoy huge discounts, however, including federal and state rebates, and the opportunity to bypass gas stations altogether. For that reason, Felix Sui, who works in technology in San Diego, loved his BMW electric car. But now that he and his wife are starting a family, he sold the lease on it so he could buy a Volvo S. U. V. โ€The XC90,โ€ he clarified. โ€The big one. โ€ A preference for big cars is not going to help the country meet the goals outlined in the Paris climate accord, reached in December. To help reach those goals, average fuel economy would need to soar to at least 100 miles per gallon  โ€”   most likely achievable only through widespread adoption of electric and other   cars, according to Ben Haley, a   of Evolved Energy Research, a consulting firm. President Obama has pushed for stronger federal   rules that call for cars to average 40 miles per gallon by 2025, according to the Environmental Protection Agency the current average is 25. 4 miles per gallon. Though electric cars may be somewhat out of favor for now, that may change. Many are hoping that the Tesla could transform Americansโ€ views on electric cars, much the way the iPhone did with mobile technology. Tesla still carries asterisks  โ€”   it is losing money, and it is not clear if the company can produce what it has promised  โ€”   but it can point to 370, 000 votes of confidence. That is how many people have put down $1, 000 to reserve one of Teslaโ€s new Model 3 cars, a significantly   version of its luxury models they wonโ€t even be out until late next year. There are hopes, too, for the 2017 Chevrolet Bolt, which boasts a range of 200 miles, nearly matching the projected range of the Tesla Model 3. Those would more than double the range of many cars on the market, helping alleviate the โ€range anxietyโ€ that many consumers feel. When Tesla first let people sign up online in March, and reservations surged to 325, 000 within a week, Dr. John Sterman, a climate expert at M. I. T. was heartened by the prospect of broader interest in   cars. โ€All my friends and colleagues were sending me links to the media reports,โ€ he said. โ€ I thought, this is great news. โ€ Years from now, he added, โ€we will look at this as a watershed moment. โ€ Others who worry about climate change can sound like boosters for the new car. โ€Tesla is notorious for performance. It can outperform the hottest, most conventional car,โ€ said Albert Ayala, deputy executive officer at the California Air Resources Board, a publicagency that governs air quality. When he gives speeches and is asked how the   market can improve, he points to Tesla and says, โ€Thatโ€s exactly what weโ€re trying to do. โ€ Seconds after preorders for the new Model 3 became available, John Meyer, 21, an entrepreneur in New York, made his reservation. At the time, he was on a flight from Newark to Los Angeles, and worried that he would miss out if the planeโ€s   went down. He called the car a โ€game changerโ€ because it has everything he wants  โ€”   it is cool, beautiful and powerful, he said, as well as being environmentally friendly. โ€I couldโ€ve bought a Prius before,โ€ he said. โ€And I would have if it looked like an Audi. โ€",0
102,"Hillary Clinton Builds $150 Million War Chest, Doubling Donald Trump - The New York Times",Nicholas Confessore and Rachel Shorey,"Donald J. Trump entered the homestretch of the campaign at a pronounced financial disadvantage to Hillary Clinton, according to figures Mr. Trumpโ€s team released on Saturday, and far below the   goal he set for himself earlier in the race. After raising $100 million in partnership with Republican Party organizations in September, Mr. Trump and committees linked to his campaign began October with $75 million in cash on hand. Mrs. Clinton raised $154 million in September and began October with roughly $150 million in the bank, her campaign said, twice as much as Mr. Trump. Many of the Republican Partyโ€s leading contributors have stayed away from his campaign, judging from financial disclosures filed by Mr. Trump and his party on Saturday, signaling his difficulties in persuading party elites to back him. One exception was Peter Thiel, the billionaire Silicon Valley investor who spoke in support of Mr. Trump at the Republican convention in July. A person close to Mr. Thiel said on Saturday that the investor was putting $1. 25 million behind Mr. Trumpโ€s campaign. Still, Mrs. Clinton will have a huge war chest for   advertising and organizing at a time when she has regained her lead in public opinion polls and Mr. Trump is openly feuding with his party and mired in accusations that he groped women. The monthly figure was a record for Mr. Trump and provided evidence of his powerful appeal among   donors: The campaign now estimates that 2. 6 million people have given to his campaign. But it was only a small improvement over his   in July and August, suggesting he might have peaked. Moreover, Mr. Trump has so far not followed through on promises to spend $100 million of his own fortune on the campaign. In September, he contributed $2 million, his usual amount since he became the Republican nominee, leaving him roughly $44 million short of his goal. Mr. Trump also said he would blitz Mrs. Clinton with $100 million in advertising, but he has spent about $32 million, according to two Republican media buyers, although they have reserved substantial additional advertising in swing states. โ€Our ad spending strategy has not changed,โ€ Hope Hicks, a Trump spokeswoman, wrote in an email. โ€Mr. Trump continues to make significant contributions to his campaign. โ€ Mr. Trump is not starved for cash and could still make additional investments in television and turnout to increase his chances on Nov. 8. But his campaign has been marred by disagreements with Republican organizations in some key states. On Saturday, Mr. Trumpโ€s campaign cut ties with Matt Borges, the chairman of the Republican Party in Ohio, a pivotal swing state. A Trump aide accused Mr. Borges of publicly undermining Mr. Trump to promote his own ambitions to run for chairman of the Republican National Committee. In a letter to other Ohio Republicans, the aide, Robert Paduchik, said Mr. Borges had spent the past week on a โ€  media tour with state and national outlets to criticize our partyโ€s nominee. โ€ Still, Mr. Paduchik added that he expected the Ohio Republican Party to keep covering payroll costs that it had been paying on behalf of Mr. Trumpโ€s campaign. Some leading Republican donors have tried an awkward straddle, providing money to a โ€super PACโ€ that is focused on attacking Mrs. Clinton but is said to be aiming its fire to achieve maximum benefit for Republican House and Senate candidates endangered by Mr. Trumpโ€s slide. That group, called Future45, received $5 million from the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson in September and the same amount from his wife, Miriam. An additional $2. 3 million came from Joe Ricketts, the TD Ameritrade founder, and other donors, including the coal magnate Joe Craft. But disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission on Saturday hinted at fragmentation and disarray among outside groups that support Mr. Trump and have competed with one another for dollars and turf. While Mr. Trumpโ€s sons and advisers have appeared at   for two groups  โ€”   Great America PAC and Rebuilding America Now  โ€”   at least three additional super PACs have organized in apparent support of him. One, called Save America From Its Government, was founded by Andrew Beal, a banker and real estate investor who is a member of Mr. Trumpโ€s economic advisory team. According to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission, Mr. Beal gave $2 million to the group in September, nearly all of the money it reported raising. A fourth group, a committee called American Horizons, was attacked by the Trump campaign this summer for promoting a โ€Dinner With Donaldโ€ contest that Mr. Trump had neither authorized nor agreed to. The complaints do not appear to have affected  : American Horizons raised $750, 000 from July to September, a third of it from donors giving hundreds of dollars each. The committee has spent just $12, 000 on expenditures backing Mr. Trump. But the biggest chunk of spending, about $400, 000, went to fees to a consulting firm owned by the PACโ€s treasurer.",0

Donald Trump stopped campaigning for just an hour-and-half to work in a brief appearance at the opening of his new hotel, whereร reporters awaited his arrival รขย€ย” one of which had a nasty surprise hidden up her sleeve. When the Republican candidate caught it mid-interview on live television, he had a priceless response that the CNN crank wonโ€t soon forget. 
Liberal news host Dana Bash is evidently no fan of Donald Trump, which sheโ€s not afraid to show in her biased reporting. Her arrogance backfired when she was in front of him at the grand opening of his hotel, thinking she could get away with a public attempt to insult him, but she got rightfully put in her place by the blunt candidate. 
Trumpโ€s schedule is jam packed with as many campaign stops as he can cram into these final weeks of the election, taking advantage of every waking moment to earn Americansโ€ votes. Somehow in the middle of his traveling to every corner of the country, he managed to squeeze in a stop at his hotelโ€s grand opening where he created countless jobs and a structure he should be proud of. However, Bash didnโ€t see it this way in her attempt to slam him for this 90-minute โ€time offโ€ he was taking from campaigning. 
During her live interview at the opening, the nasty CNN reporter had the audacity to sneak in this question: โ€For people who say youรขย€ยre taking time out of swing states to go do this, you say?โ€ She painted this pit stop as an irresponsible thing to do while Hillary Clinton is working hard.

โ€” Deplorable AJ (@asamjulian) October 26, 2016 
Trump wasnโ€t going to allow her to get away with asking such a disgusting thing, given the vast difference in effort between him and his opponent and didnโ€t mince a single word in his priceless answer. 
โ€I say the following. You have been covering me for the last, long time. I did yesterday 8 stops and 3 major speeches. And Iรขย€ยve been doing this for weeks straight. I left for here for an hour-and-a-half. Iรขย€ยm leaving here and going to North Carolina, then Iรขย€ยm going to Florida, then Iรขย€ยm going up to New Hampshire. For you to ask me that question is actually very insulting because Hillary Clinton does one stop and then goes home and sleeps. And yet you ask me that question. I think itรขย€ยs a very rude question .โ€ 
Bash didnโ€t see that coming, and Trump proved once again why America needs an unapologetic leader like him. He tells it how it is and backs up what he says with real action, unlike his competition who puts in a couple of days of campaigning and calls it good since itโ€s all for show anyway. 
Trump is putting in ten times the effort with genuine work ethic on his own dime to honestly earn the votes, and if he wants to take a couple of minutes to make an appearance at an opening, heโ€s more than entitled to do it. It pales in comparison to the weeks Hillary has had off relaxing and recovering. Trumpโ€s creating jobs as heโ€s campaigning, but Hillaryโ€s just napping.",1
104,All 100 Senators Contacted Russian Government This Week,Joel B. Pollak,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions found himself at the center of controversy this week because he answered a question about the Trump campaignโ€s contacts with the Russian government without talking about his contacts as a United States Senator. [The assumption made by the media, the Democrats, and even some Republicans was that even routine contact with the Russian government is burdened by suspicion of collusion. Not since the McCarthy era have suspicions reached such levels.  But if Sessions ought to resign, perhaps the entire Senate should quit. Because on Monday  โ€”   two days before the Washington Post broke the highly scandalous story that Sessions had met the Russian ambassador twice in the course of his duties  โ€”   every single United States Senator had formal contact with the Russian government. And not just any functionary: they had contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin himself. Worse (apparently) still, they initiated the contact with the Russians. The contact was a letter, signed by the entire Senate, urging Putin to release a valuable library of Jewish religious texts that was seized by earlier Russian regimes and which has been the subject of a legal and diplomatic dispute in recent decades. Senate Letter Re Chabad  โ€”   2017  โ€”   Without Hatch Signature by Breitbart News on Scribd,  Senator Orrin Hatch ( ) provided the final signature on the letter, and tweeted proudly about his support for the effort: For the last year, Hatch has led his colleagues in an effort to recover the texts, including a letter signed by all 100 Senators. ( ) pic. twitter.   โ€”   Senator Hatch Office (@SenOrrinHatch) February 28, 2017,   None of that means Sessions should have misled Congress  โ€”   but the point is, again, that he did not. Ordinary contact with foreign governments is such a routine part of the job that he did not think to mention it, just as no one mentioned the Putin letter this week, even in the heat of debate about which senators might have met the Russian ambassador, and when and why.

105,10 Images That Perfectly Illustrate the Struggle Against the Dakota Access Pipeline,The Anti-Media,"
By Nick Bernabe
The struggle to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline has been mired in police brutality and militarization. In fact, many have likened the atmosphere in Standing Rock, North Dakota, to a war zone.
The corporate media initially refused to cover the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, though the ongoing storyโ€s virality on social media eventually forced it into the mainstream. Even now that the #NoDAPL movement has developed into a national political narrative, the media continues to whitewash the severity of the crackdown against the Native American protesters, who call themselves โ€water protectors.โ€
Below are 10 images I have come across (while closely following the Dakota Access Pipeline protests for Anti-Media ) that narrate the struggle at Standing Rock:

106,"Washington State Takes 10 Refugees, 0 Muslim Rest of Country Takes 189 Refugees, 151 Muslim - Breitbart",Michael Patrick Leahy,"On Tuesday, the second full weekday after Federal Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order halting President Trumpโ€s executive order that temporarily blocked the issuance of visas for seven Middle Eastern countries and temporarily banned refugees from all countries, ten refugees arrived in the state of Washington. [None of them were Muslim. All ten were from the Ukraine, and were either Baptist, Evangelical Christian, Uniate (a branch of Christian denomination found in eastern Europe) or Pentecostalist, according to the Department of Stateโ€s interactive website.  Across the rest of the country, it was a different story. More than 75 percent of the 189 refugees who arrived in other parts of the United States on Tuesday, 151 in total, were Muslim, according to the Department of Stateโ€s interactive website. It was the ultimate irony, since Judge Robart based his decision on an argument from Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson that Trumpโ€s executive order was unconstitutional because it was motivated by a desire to ban Muslims. โ€Prior to his election, Donald Trump campaigned on the promise that he would ban Muslims from entering the United States,โ€ Ferguson alleged in the Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief filed by the state of Washington with the United States District Court Western District of Washington on January 30, 2017: On December 7, 2015, candidate Trump issued a press release calling for โ€a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. โ€ As of the date of this filing, the press release remains available on Trumpโ€s campaign website and is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. In defending his decision shortly thereafter, candidate Trump compared the Muslim ban to former President Franklin Rooseveltโ€s decision to intern Japanese Americans during World War II, and stated, โ€This is a president highly respected by all, [Roosevelt] did the same thing. โ€ A media report of this interview is attached hereto as Exhibit 2. On June 14, 2016, candidate Trump reiterated his promise to ban all Muslims entering this country until โ€we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screenthose people coming into our country. โ€ โ€Section 3 of the Executive Order, if implemented, will result in substantial burdens on the exercise of religion by   immigrants by, for example, preventing them from exercising their religion while in detention, returning to their religious communities in Washington,   taking upcoming, planned religious travel abroad. Such burdens on religion violate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,โ€ Ferguson argued in the January 30 complaint. In response to the Department of Justiceโ€s appeal of Judge Robartโ€s decision to the 9th Federal Circuit Court, Ferguson restated that claim. โ€Here, the State [of Washington] has plausibly alleged with sufficient particularity that the President acted in bad faith in an effort to target Muslims,โ€ Ferguson argued  in Statesโ€ Response to Emergency Motion Under Circuit Rule   for Administrative Stay and Motion for Stay Pending Appeal filed with the 9th Federal Circuit Court on February 6, continuing with that theme. In the week between President Trumpโ€s signing of the executive order on January 27 and Judge Robartโ€s issuance of the temporary restraining order halting it nationwide on February 3, the Trump administration granted waivers allowing 842 refugees to enter the country. One hundred and   of those refugees, or 15 percent, were Muslim, according to the State Departmentโ€s interactive website.",0

108,"NCAA, Big 12 Keeps Watchful Eye on Texas Bathroom Bill - Breitbart",Warner Todd Huston,"Texas is one of a list of states looking to institute their own transgender bathroom restrictions, quite regardless of the guff North Carolina took for its own bill last year. Predictably, just as it did against North Carolina, the NCAA and the Big 12 Conference look to act against Texas over the law. [After North Carolina passed its 2016 House Bill 2, which restricted some bathrooms, the NCAA decided to pull all tournament games from the state in protest over what the organization labeled โ€discrimination. โ€  At the time, the AP wrote that the stateโ€s governor criticized the NCAA for the move. โ€Gov. Pat McCrory says the NCAA failed to show North Carolina respect when it moved championships and tournament games out of the state because of a law that governs which bathrooms transgender people must use,โ€ the AP said. Now that Texas walks down the same legislative path that North Carolina blazed, the NCAA and Big 12 again look to punish a state. Announcing the effort in Texas, Lone Star State Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said of the new bill, โ€This issue is not about discrimination  โ€”   itโ€s about public safety, protecting businesses and common sense,โ€ according to USA Today. Since the announcement in Texas, the NCAA has put the state on notice that they are watching. While the NCAA itself didnโ€t have a statement at this time, the Big 12 did have something to say. โ€The Big 12 Conference is aware of the filing of Senate Bill 6 in the Texas State legislature,โ€ said Big 12 spokesman Bob Burda. โ€We will track the billโ€s progress through the legislature, and at an appropriate time discuss its impact with our member institutions. โ€ The NCAA acted quickly and with prejudice against North Carolina, but itโ€s unclear whether it will act in a similar, swift manner against Texas. With at least five other states across the country contemplating similar bills, it may come to diminishing returns for the leagues to act in boycott. The boycott of one state came easy for them, but if five or more pass bathroom laws similar to North Carolinaโ€s the leagues may end up on the outside looking in. Along with Texas, other states now beginning the process of debating and enacting a bathroom bill include Alabama, Missouri, South Carolina, Virginia, and Washington.

109,"Massive ESPN Financial, Subscriber Losses Drag Down Disneyโ€s First-Quarter Sales - Breitbart",Dylan Gwinn,"A year that saw arguably the five greatest championship game performances of all time should have helped right the ship for ESPN, and at the very least stopped the trend of massive subscriber losses which have plagued the   sports giant for the last few years. [Well, that did not happen, and ESPN appears to be a sinking ship, dragging parent company Disney down with it.  Bloomberg reports that ESPN badly hurt Disneyโ€s first quarter sales, falling well short of projections. According to The Wrap, โ€Cable networks, particularly ESPN, have been an albatross on Disneyโ€s stock price even as the companyโ€s two other major prongs, movies and theme parks, continue to perform well. As cheaper TV alternatives began to proliferate, ESPN hemorrhaged subscribers during the course of 2016 and is now at less than 88 million, compared with a peak of 100. 1 million in 2011. At an estimated $7 per subscriber, that dip has been a substantial hit to Disney, especially considering media networks made up 49 percent of Disneyโ€s profits during fiscal 2016. โ€ In other words, everyone else at Disney met or exceeded their projected goals, except for ESPN who lost more than twelve million subscribers in just under six years. But, the problem for ESPN goes deeper than just losing subscribers and money. The Wrap explains, โ€At the same time, rights fees for the live sports ESPN specializes in broadcasting continue to go up, as thereโ€s plenty of competition for one of the few pieces of programmed television that still delivers monster ratings. ESPN will pay $7. 3 billion for content this year  โ€”   the biggest price tag among all media companies. Operating income at Disneyโ€s cable networks division  โ€”   primarily ESPN  โ€”   plunged 11 percent compared with the same time the previous year. Disney attributed that drop entirely to lower ESPN revenue. โ€ Less cash on hand means less cash to purchase rights to sporting events, which can prove particularly harmful to an entity that considers itself a sports network. Now, Disney and ESPN have laid much of the blame for their subscriber loss at the feet of the cord cutting phenomenon that has impacted all cable providers to some degree. Thatโ€s a fair point, but ESPNโ€s losses have far exceeded the pace and rate of losses among other providers. ESPN will also cite the fact that theyโ€re rolling out more   streaming content that will offset much of the losses theyโ€ve taken on the cable side. Great, but what will ESPN show on those streaming channels? Will they show the   equivalent of Jason Batemanโ€s ESPN โ€The Ocho?โ€ I enjoy a good game of dodgeball as much as the next guy, but unless ESPN plans on exclusively featuring the NFL, or   NBA games on their streaming networks, virtually no one will watch. Not to mention, itโ€s highly unlikely that either the NBA or the NFL would enter into a contract with ESPN which allowed them to only offer their games via stream. So, what can ESPN do? In November, ESPN ombudsman Jim Brady wrote that he felt the network had become too liberal, turning off half the country and potentially effecting viewership and subscribership. Sadly, three months after that rare and blinding light of truth and honesty thereโ€s no reason to believe anything has changed regarding the politics of ESPN. Not when you have hosts like ESPNโ€s Ryen Rusillo stating, on the air, that he no longer knows what his job is, since everyone around him just wants to bash Trump and talk liberal politics, instead of talking about sports. Maybe, if ESPN focused more on sports instead of alienating half the country, their business wouldnโ€t be circling the drain right now. After all, Lady Gaga just did a halftime show in which she decided to not enrage half the country, and got rewarded with an enormous surge in digital music sales. Imagine that. Donโ€t insult the country and theyโ€ll consume your product. Who would have thought? Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn",0
110,"Megyn Kelly, Contract Set to Expire Next Year, Is Primed for the Big Show - The New York Times",John Koblin,"Barbara Walters is retired, Oprah Winfrey is running a network and Megyn Kelly sees an opening. โ€Itโ€s there for the taking right now,โ€ she said in a recent interview. And what is there for the taking? What those famous hosts had accomplished: conducting the sort of interviews that could transfix a nation. โ€Those were the biggest spots to go for an interview if you had something you wanted to get off your chest, if you were in the middle of a scandal or a major news story and you wanted to do a     to get past it or to go on the record,โ€ she said. She quickly added: โ€And Iโ€m here!โ€ Making the Oprah or Barbara Walters leap is a remarkably tricky business. Many have tried before, with daytime shows or   specials, only to run into a wall and return to a more comfortable corner of television. And the interview special is a relic from a time on television when what was broadcast on the Big Four networks was what mattered most. But on Tuesday, Ms. Kelly, the Fox News anchor and host of โ€The Kelly File,โ€ will take her first crack at a   special on Fox  โ€”   the broadcast network, not the cable news station  โ€”   with โ€Megyn Kelly Presents. โ€ There is certainly one big hook to draw viewers: She will confront the likely Republican presidential nominee, Donald J. Trump, a man who over the last nine months has kept Ms. Kelly in the middle of a running news story by relentlessly attacking her. And though Mr. Trump represents the   get, she will also interview two actors (Michael Douglas and Laverne Cox) and a lawyer (Robert Shapiro) who is back in the news after the successful O. J. Simpson anthology โ€American Crime Storyโ€ on FX. Mr. Trump aside, it is with those interviews that Ms. Kelly hopes to accomplish something new: prove that she can do much more than simply host a nightly news show. If all goes well, she will display range and versatility at a convenient time. Her contract with Fox News is set to expire in a little more than a year. โ€I would like to prove to myself that I have these other muscles,โ€ she said, as she sat in her cramped office on Sixth Avenue. โ€It doesnโ€t all have to be   level of difficulty. It can be other kinds of questioning where you get more to somebodyโ€s humanity and tell their story. โ€ She said that one of her benchmarks for success was if viewers said: โ€I saw Megyn in a new light. โ€ Her Fox News show, โ€The Kelly File,โ€ has been a hit for more than two years, but Ms. Kelly, who is 45, is in the middle of a big moment in her career. Since Mr. Trump began attacking her after the first Republican debate in August, Ms. Kelly has approached something close to genuine celebrity status. She was on the cover of Vanity Fair in February, she has made the rounds of the   circuit over the last three months. She also made her first appearance at the Met Gala in early May, the lavish Manhattan event that effectively serves as the yearโ€s social register for the rich and famous. There is also a book in the works  โ€”   she is handing in the manuscript to her editor at HarperCollins later this month and spent the last week writing the Trump section. It comes out the week after Election Day in November, and Tuesday will bring her the first   special. There are real questions whether the   โ€specialโ€ can attract a meaningful audience and lift a career. Long gone are the days when Ms. Walters could attract an audience of about 50 million people, as her exclusive interview with Monica Lewinsky did in 1999. But even in a fragmented TV landscape, they can occasionally break through. Last year, Caitlyn Jennerโ€s revelation that she was transgender in an interview with Diane Sawyer drew nearly 17 million viewers, which qualifies as a huge hit these days. Ms. Kelly was reluctant to discuss a ratings goal. The producer for โ€Megyn Kelly Presents,โ€ the veteran TV newsman Bill Geddie, pointed out that Fox did not ordinarily run these type of news specials and that expectations should be managed accordingly. โ€Megyn said it right: Weโ€re looking for a single here,โ€ he said. The special can accomplish other goals for her instead. The news cycle has been relentlessly focused on politics and Ms. Kelly said she was more than happy to take a break from that. She is not a political junkie. โ€Thatโ€s not all I am,โ€ she said โ€I love covering the news, but Iโ€m not a political person, so I donโ€t know that I get the jones out of immersing myself in politics all day, every day the way some others do. โ€ She added, โ€You look out at the news landscape, and there isnโ€t the one perfect job that would service the soul. โ€ If that turn of phrase makes her sound a little like Oprah, it is probably not by accident. She pointed to Ms. Winfrey and Charlie Rose to illustrate her broader goals. โ€Oprahโ€s a bit more spiritual and helps improve peopleโ€s lives, which I also would like to do,โ€ she said. โ€Charlie has a thing that I donโ€t have. He will sit down with Brian Dennehy, whoโ€s got an amazing show on Broadway, and talk to him about it. Heโ€ll sit down with business executives like Tim Cook and talk to him about whatโ€s happening in his life. โ€ And if Ms. Kelly wants to be part Oprah, part Charlie Rose and also fill the Barbara Walters vacuum (โ€Who in their right mind would reject that?โ€ she said of Ms. Walters) she got the right producer. Mr. Geddie produced more than 100 of Ms. Waltersโ€s   specials. โ€Megyn Kelly Presentsโ€ will be quite a departure from her regular   show: Say goodbye to the talking heads and   cuts, and cue a gauzier look, with two comfortable chairs and a contemplative head nod. โ€Itโ€s nice to step outside of it every once in a while and try out the Louis Vuitton luggage,โ€ she said. This is, of course, leads to the   question: What will happen when her contract expires next year? Whether or not the special is a success, she will have plenty of suitors lined up. And Fox News is keen to keep her. The special was the brainchild of the Fox News chairman, Roger Ailes, Ms. Kelly said. And she expressed loyalty to Mr. Ailes when asked about her future. โ€The number of times heโ€s had my back, given me opportunities, stuck his own neck out there to protect me, I feel very grateful to him. โ€ She continued: โ€Having said that, this is a fickle business, and you never say never. Every time Iโ€ve been up for a contract negotiation Iโ€ve been   to what possibilities exist. โ€ Though the special may show how adept she is at interviewing a celebrity, much of the attention on Tuesday night will ultimately be on Mr. Trump, who made her his No. 1 media nemesis with his famous description of โ€blood coming out of her   โ€ฆ     wherever. โ€ Ms. Kelly said she planned to contact him for months but the attacks on her kept coming (Mr. Trump tweeted regularly about her, calling her โ€Crazy Megyn,โ€ and he skipped the second Fox News debate in late January because of Ms. Kellyโ€s involvement). She wanted him for this special, but it was not an easy assignment. Even Mr. Geddie, who has known Mr. Trump for 20 years, reached out and was given a flat no. It was not until April that Ms. Kelly reached out to Mr. Trump for the first time since the debate in August. She later met him alone at the Trump Tower to discuss the interview. Less than two weeks later, he was in. Though she concedes that Mr. Trump has made her โ€name better known,โ€ she also refers to the last year as a dark one. There have been security concerns, and the stream of tweets from Mr. Trump and his supporters has been unpleasant. โ€This is one of the things that I get into with Trump in the interview,โ€ she said. โ€Not about me but about whether he realizes the power his words have on the lives of his targets. Not just Megyn Kelly. โ€ In a campaign cycle in which the news media has been roundly criticized for kowtowing to Mr. Trump, Ms. Kelly has mostly been above it all. She even said on a March show: โ€Iโ€m the    show in all of cable news and I havenโ€t had Trump on in seven months. It can be done without him too. โ€ With the apparent rapprochement, is Ms. Kelly worried about the perception that she, too, is doing whatever needs to be done to get him for an interview? โ€Listen, if I werenโ€t a journalist, would I have called up Trump and said โ€Letโ€s meetโ€? No, I would not,โ€ she said. โ€But itโ€s because Iโ€m a journalist he was attacking me to begin with. So, no, you cannot compare me trying to put an end to his   barrage so that I can cover him like a normal journalist with the    obsessive coverage we have seen of his candidacy. โ€ Ms. Kelly expressed some frustration that she had been in the news for so long. Asked whether she thought Mr. Trumpโ€s attacks would end after the special was broadcast, she took a long pause, and said, without a great deal of confidence: โ€I hope so. One never knows. โ€",0
111,Teacher Suspended for Allowing Students to Hit Trump Pinata for Cinco de Mayo,Katherine Rodriguez,"A high school Spanish teacher from Colorado has been suspended after she reportedly made a piรฑata with President Trumpโ€s face on it and allowed her students to hit it.

113,Snap Shares Leap 44% in Debut as Investors Doubt Value Will Vanish - The New York Times,Michael J. de la Merced,"Snapchat is a business built in large part on disappearing messages and adding animated dog ears and flower crowns to usersโ€ selfies. As of Thursday, that business is worth about $34 billion  โ€”   more than the market value of the   media company CBS, and about three times the size of another social media company, Twitter. Snapchat has made paper billionaires of its   founders five times over. In making its stock market debut in spectacular fashion  โ€”   its shares rising 44 percent on their first day of trading  โ€”   Snapchatโ€s parent, Snap Inc. has blazed a trail for other technology darlings like Uber and Spotify that remain privately held. It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months. The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its   user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchatโ€s founders control for decades to come. Then there are the shadows of onetime tech highfliers that have since crashed to earth. Twitter was valued at nearly $32 billion at the end of its first day of trading Wall Street now values it at roughly $11 billion and has called for the company to sell itself. An earlier force in social media, Myspace, sold itself to Rupert Murdochโ€s News Corporation for $580 million in 2005 six years later, it was sold to Justin Timberlake and other investors for $35 million. Some analysts have already shown skepticism about the newest publicly traded tech giant. One, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, says the share price should be $10, far below the companyโ€s offering price of $17, which itself was above the initial range predicted. Snap faces competition from larger companies and the challenge of a   user base, he said. Boosters of Snapโ€s prospects argue instead that Snap has the potential to become less like Twitter and more like its biggest rival, the $395 billion Facebook. These supporters point to some of the companyโ€s obvious strengths: the 158 million people on average who used Snapchat each day by the end of 2016 the roughly 18 times a day that those users opened the app on average the $404 million in sales that it collected last year, up from nothing three years ago. For now, investors appeared to focus on the positive. Snap raised $3. 4 billion in its market debut, the most by an American tech company since Facebookโ€s initial offering in 2012, according to data from Renaissance Capital. It was the first significant tech stock sale since at least December. And the 44 percent pop in its stock price was the biggest enjoyed by a company of a   I. P. O. since Twitterโ€s debut in 2013. More than 217 million shares traded on Thursday, as some investors bought and others cashed in, exceeding the number of shares Snap sold in the I. P. O. For investors in other   unicorns  โ€”   a term for   valued at more than $1 billion  โ€”   the immense success of Snapโ€s deal highlights the appetite for a tech darling, even if the company still bleeds money. Count Uber, Spotify and Airbnb within that group. โ€The sound youโ€re hearing today after the Snap I. P. O. is the happy snapping of fingers of   unicorns and their investors,โ€ said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. โ€It looks like Snap has set the path to monetization. โ€ In countless meetings during a   roadshow with investors, Snap executives sought to rebut some of the biggest concerns about the companyโ€s prospects. Slowing growth toward the end of last year stemmed from problems with the serviceโ€s Android app. Competition from Facebook, which openly copied some of Snapchatโ€s signature features at Instagram, would do little to dent user enthusiasm. And the company would continue to press innovations, such as the branded lens filters that transform users into monsters, fairies or Taco Bell tacos, and that have become new forms of advertising beloved by brands. Potential new ideas include drones and   cameras. By Wednesday night, Snapโ€s bankers had drawn up their list of the investors who would get the first shares, largely big mutual funds and some hedge funds, all with the aim of picking firms that are most likely to stick around for the long term. The I. P. O. minted wealth for others that invested when it was a younger company, including big venture capital firms like Benchmark Capital and a high school in the Bay Area. Unlike newly public companies that seek to celebrate their first day of trading on the stock markets, Snap kept its festivities largely confined to the New York Stock Exchange. The companyโ€s top executives and board members gathered there for a   breakfast, where guests were presented with pins in the shape of Snapchatโ€s ghost mascot. Evan Spiegel, 26, and Bobby Murphy, 28, Snapโ€s founders, briefly addressed the crowd, uncharacteristically clad in suits and ties rather than their customary  . They also presented exchange officials with their version of the customary gift given by market debutants: one of the vending machines that sell the companyโ€s Spectacles,   sunglasses that send   videos to the app. (The machine wonโ€t be refilled once it sells out of Spectacles.) Then the founders walked through the floor of an exchange bedecked in the companyโ€s signature yellow  โ€”   the color splayed on electronic boards, wrapped around water bottles and leaping off some executivesโ€ ties. One Snap employee had ducked into the Hermรจs store down the street to pick up a yellow tie days before just for the occasion. Mr. Spiegelโ€s fiancรฉe, the supermodel Miranda Kerr, enthusiastically documented the day on her own Snapchat Story and posed for selfies. Attendees on the floor could unlock a special filter that placed the companyโ€s ghost mascot in their videos, holding virtual Snapchat balloons and ejecting a rainbow from its mouth. At 9:30 a. m. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy rang the Big Boardโ€s opening bell and then briefly basked in the adulation. Snapโ€s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, escorted his family around the exchange and posed for pictures with fellow employees. But by the time Snapโ€s shares opened for trading at $24 each  โ€”   which was later in the morning  โ€”   the companyโ€s top executives had disappeared from the floor, heading to the nearby offices of one of the banks involved in the public offering, Goldman Sachs, to watch the opening. Then many staff members trekked to Snapโ€s Midtown Manhattan offices to head back to work.",0
114,Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillaryโ€s Benghazi Hearing,admin,"Zero Hedge October 26, 2016 
In the latest revelation sure to reignite accusations of collusion between the Clinton campaign and the DOJ, among the recent batch of hacked emails released by Wikileaks, we learn that the day after Hillary Clinton testified in front of the House Select Committee on Benghazi last October, John Podesta, Hillaryโ€s campaign chairman met for dinner with a small group of well-connected friends, including Peter Kadzik , who is currently a top official at the US Justice Department serving as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs. 
Peter Kadzik, with lobbyist Tony Podesta, brother of John Podesta . 
The post-Benghazi dinner was attended by Podesta, Kadzik, superlobbyist Vincent Roberti and other well-placed Beltway fixtures. The first mention of personal contact between Podesta and Kadzik in the Wikileaks dump is in an Oct. 23, 2015 email sent out by Vincent Roberti, a lobbyist who is close to Podesta and his superlobbyist brother, Tony Podesta. In it, Roberti refers to a dinner reservation at Posto, a Washington D.C. restaurant. The dinner was set for 7:30 that evening, just one day after Clinton gave 11 hours of testimony to the Benghazi Committee . 
Podesta and Kadzik met several months later for dinner at Podestaโ€s home, another email shows . Another email sent on May 5, 2015 , Kadzikโ€s son asked Podesta for a job on the Clinton campaign. 
As the Daily Caller notes , the dinner arrangement โ€is just the latest example of an apparent conflict of interest between the Clinton campaign and the federal agency charged with investigating the former secretary of stateโ€s email practices.โ€ As one former U.S. Attorney tells told the DC, the exchanges are another example of the Clinton campaignโ€s โ€cozy relationshipโ€ with the Obama Justice Department. 
The hacked emails confirm that Podesta and Kadzik were in frequent contact. In one email from January, Kadzik and Podesta, who were classmates at Georgetown Law School in the 1970s, discussed plans to celebrate Podestaโ€s birthday. And in another sent last May, Kadzikโ€s son emailed Podesta asking for a job on the Clinton campaign. A d v e r t i s e m e n t 
โ€The political appointees in the Obama administration, especially in the Department of Justice, appear to be very partisan in nature and I donโ€t think had clean hands when it comes to the investigation of the private email server,โ€ says Matthew Whitaker, the executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a government watchdog group. 
โ€ Itโ€s the kind of thing the American people are frustrated about is that the politically powerful have insider access and have these kind of relationships that ultimately appear to always break to the benefit of Hillary Clinton ,โ€ he added, comparing the Podesta-Kadzik meetings to the revelation that Attorney General Loretta Lynch met in private with Bill Clinton at the airport in Phoenix days before the FBI and DOJ investigating Hillary Clinton. 
Kadzikโ€s role at the DOJ, where he started in 2013, is particularly notable Kadzik, as helped spearhead the effort to nominate Lynch, who was heavily criticized for her secret meeting with the former president. 
A Long, Friendly History 
Podesta and Kadzik have a long history, one which has surprisingly gone mostly unnoticed during the ongoing Clinton email scandal. As DC helps summarize, Kadzik represented Podesta during the Monica Lewinsky investigation. And in the waning days of the Bill Clinton administration, Kadzik lobbied Podesta on behalf of Marc Rich, the fugitive who Bill Clinton controversially pardoned on his last day in office. 
That history is cited by Podesta in another email hacked from his Gmail account. In a Sept. 2008 email , which the Washington Free Beacon flagged last week, Podesta emailed an Obama campaign official to recommend Kadzik for a supportive role in the campaign. Podesta, who would later head up the Obama White House transition effort, wrote that Kadzik was a โ€fantastic lawyerโ€ who โ€ kept me out of jail.โ€ 
As the DC Chuck Ross notes, it is unclear to which case Podesta was referring and whether he was joking about prison. But Podesta was caught in a sticky situation in both the Lewinsky affair and the Rich pardon scandal. As deputy chief of staff to Clinton in 1996, Podesta asked then-United Nations ambassador Bill Richardson to hire the 23-year-old Lewinsky . In April 1996, the White House transferred Lewinsky from her job as a White House intern to the Pentagon in order to keep her and Bill Clinton separate. But the Clinton team also wanted to keep Lewinsky happy so that she would not spill the beans about her sexual relationship with Clinton. 
Richardson later recounted in his autobiography that he offered Lewinsky the position but that she declined it. 
Podesta made false statements to a grand jury impaneled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for the investigation. But he defended the falsehoods, saying later that he was merely relaying false information from Clinton that he did not know was inaccurate at the time. โ€He did lie to me,โ€ Podesta said about Clinton in a National Public Radio interview in 1998. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in Feb. 1999 of perjury and obstruction of justice charges related to the Lewinsky probe. Kadzik, then a lawyer with the firm Dickstein Shapiro Morin & Oshinsky, represented Podesta through the fiasco. 
Podesta had been promoted to Clintonโ€s chief of staff when he and Kadzik became embroiled in another scandal. 
Kadzik was then representing Marc Rich, a billionaire financier who was wanted by the U.S. government for evading a $48 million tax bill. The fugitive, who was also implicated in illegal trading activity with nations that sponsored terrorism, had been living in Switzerland for 17 years when he sought the pardon. To help Rich, Kadzik lobbied Podesta heavily in the weeks before Clinton left office on Jan. 20, 2001. A House Oversight Committee report released in May 2002 stated that โ€Kadzik was recruited into Marc Richโ€s lobbying campaign because he was a long-time friend of White House Chief of Staff John Podesta.โ€ 
The report noted that Kadzik contacted Podesta at least seven times regarding Richโ€s pardon. 
On top of the all-hands-on-deck lobbying effort, Richโ€s ex-wife, Denise Rich, had doled out more than $1 million to the Clintons and other Democrats prior to the pardon. She gave $100,000 to Hillary Clintonโ€s New York Senate campaign and another $450,000 to the Clinton presidential library. 
Kadzikโ€s current role 
In his current role as head of the Office of Legislative Affairs, Kadzik handles inquiries from Congress on a variety of issues. In that role he was not in the direct chain of command on the Clinton investigation. The Justice Department and FBI have insisted that career investigators oversaw the investigation, which concluded in July with no charges filed against Clinton. 
But Kadzik worked on other Clinton email issues in his dealings with Congress. Last November, he denied a request from Republican lawmakers to appoint a special counsel to lead the investigation . 
In a Feb. 1, 2016 letter in response to Kadzik, Florida Rep. Ron DeSantis noted that Kadzik had explained โ€that special counsel may be appointed at the discretion of the Attorney General when an investigation or prosecution by the Department of Justice would create a potential conflict of interest.โ€ 
DeSantis, a Republican, suggested that Lynchโ€s appointment by Bill Clinton in 1999 as U.S. Attorney in New York may be considered a conflict of interest. He also asserted that Obamaโ€s political appointees โ€” a list which includes Kadzik โ€” โ€are being asked to impartially execute their respective duties as Department of Justice officials that may involve an investigation into the activities of the forerunner for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. โ€ 
It is unknown if Kadzik responded to DeSantisโ€ questions. 
Kadzikโ€s first involvement in the Clinton email brouhaha came in a Sept. 24, 2015 response letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley in which he declined to confirm or deny whether the DOJ was investigating Clinton. Last month, Politico reported that Kadzik angered Republican lawmakers when, in a classified briefing, he declined to say whether Clinton aides who received DOJ immunity were required to cooperate with congressional probes. 
Kadzik also testified at a House Oversight Committee hearing last month on the issue of classifications and redactions in the FBIโ€s files of the Clinton email investigation. This article was posted: Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 9:52 am Share this article",1

Executive producer Kevin Falls revealed the networkโ€s decision on his Twitter feed, thanking the โ€faithful fansโ€ for โ€trying so hardโ€ to save the show. Iโ€m sorry to tell you that @PITCHonFOX will not be getting a second season. #Pitch,  โ€”   Kevin Falls (@KevinFalls) May 2, 2017,  Falls heads up Left Coast Productions, and if โ€Pitchโ€ was any indication, then the โ€leftโ€ part of that moniker is fitting.

116,"Seeking Best Fit, Womenโ€s Final Four Returns to Friday-Sunday - The New York Times",Jerรฉ Longman,"DALLAS  โ€”   The womenโ€s Final Four is a showcase in search of a proper audience. In recent years, the N. C. A. A. has explored various options for rejuvenating its most popular womenโ€s sporting event, seeking to counter indifferent attendance at this marquee championship. A study in 2013 offered several bold ideas, like holding the Womenโ€s Final Four at the same site as the menโ€s event, or even moving it to Europe, China, Russia or Qatar. Another, less radical, proposal was to return the Final Four to a   format, from  . The new schedule was adopted for this year, and so on Friday night, the national semifinals took place at American Airlines Center here, with South Carolina defeating Stanford,   in the first game before Mississippi State upset Connecticut,   in the second. Capacity crowds were expected for the two semifinals and the final, the N. C. A. A. said. With weekend games, fans do not have to miss a considerable part of the workweek to attend the Final Four, as they did when the championship game was played on a Tuesday night from 2003 to 2016. (The menโ€s Final Four continues to have a   format.) Also, some believed the womenโ€s final had begun to feel anticlimactic when it was played a night after the menโ€s final. That seemed especially true last year, when Villanova defeated North Carolina on a   shot the day before UConn swamped Syracuse by 31 points. โ€The reason we moved to   was based on a lot of surveys and people saying, from a fan experience, that having to take that whole additional week off when we played on Tuesday was difficult,โ€ said Rick Nixon, the N. C. A. A.โ€s associate director of championships and a spokesman for the organization. โ€To be in a   situation here in Dallas on Friday and Sunday, I think itโ€s worked out. โ€ In effect, the N. C. A. A. seems to have put a higher premium on a full arena than expanded television ratings. Fridayโ€s semifinals were to be broadcast on ESPN2, competing with an N. B. A. doubleheader on ESPN featuring San   City and Golden  . Sundayโ€s championship game will not have its accustomed   slot on ESPN, either. Instead, it will start at 6 p. m. Eastern time, ahead of the networkโ€s opening night coverage of Major League Baseball, featuring the World Series champion Chicago Cubs at rival St. Louis. โ€Weโ€re anxious to see where the ratings play out,โ€ Nixon said. โ€It might not be all bad. โ€ ESPN said it would have preferred to retain the   format. Kara Lawson, a commentator, told The Hartford Courant that the move to ESPN2 of Fridayโ€s semifinals, usually broadcast on ESPN, was a โ€big bummer for exposure of the game. โ€ Carol Stiff, vice president for womenโ€s sports programming at ESPN, was more sanguine. An arena at capacity is โ€good for the game,โ€ she said, and in reference to the womenโ€s final, she added, โ€I think we might pull in more numbers on a Sunday. โ€ The final will be promoted as part of a โ€Super Sunday,โ€ Stiff said. โ€From the crowning of a champion to handing it over to the Cubs, itโ€s a pretty big day. โ€ Not everyone was pleased with the time slots for Fridayโ€s semifinals. The tipoff for   Carolina was set for 7:30 p. m. while UConn was set to play Mississippi State at closer to 10 p. m. The Huskies draw the biggest ratings in womenโ€s college basketball, but Coach Geno Auriemma said he was not happy that his team would have to wait around all day to play. โ€Iโ€ve said this in the past  โ€”   TV and whatโ€s going on in the actual arena donโ€t go together,โ€ he said on Thursday. He added: โ€We have to figure out how to work together, make it work for the   because we always use that term, you know. Whatโ€s best for the  ? Not playing at 10 at night. โ€ Another underlying issue in womenโ€s college basketball is the debate about whether the dominance of UConn  โ€”   with its   winning streak entering Friday, and its four consecutive national championships  โ€”   is good or bad for the development of the sport. On the face of it, it might seem absurd to claim that sustained excellence was somehow detrimental. While the womenโ€s regionals had their lowest average attendance in 20 years, according to The Associated Press, with an average of 4, 719 fans at each game, UConn sold out both the regional semifinal and the final in Bridgeport, Conn. drawing announced crowds of 8, 978. In February, when UConn won its 100th consecutive game, against South Carolina, it drew the highest television rating of the season, to that point, on ESPN2 for any college game, menโ€s or womenโ€s. โ€I think theyโ€re great for the game,โ€ Stiff said of Auriemma and the Huskies. โ€Every time theyโ€re on, people are tuning in. They want to know, what is special about this team? Whatโ€s in the sauce? Can he coach men? Whatโ€s the magic in the potion? This was supposed to be his down year. โ€",0
117,A Proposal for a Canadian National Bird Ruffles Feathers - The New York Times,Ian Austen,"OTTAWA  โ€”   With Canadaโ€s 150th anniversary looming next year, a gap was noticed in the countryโ€s roster of patriotic icons. It had a national anthem, a national tree, two national animals, two national sports  โ€”   but no national bird. That would not do. The United States has the bald eagle, Mexico the golden eagle, France the rooster. Down in El Salvador they have the   motmot. But Canada, one of the worldโ€s major bird habitats, had gone a century and a half without ever choosing an avian avatar. Why? The Department of Canadian Heritage, the official government keeper of symbols, could not explain it. Neither could ornithologists, nor the editor of Canadian Geographic magazine, Aaron Kylie. So the Royal Canadian Geographic Society, which publishes the magazine and perhaps saw a chance for some nice publicity, took up the   task of selecting one. And boy, did it ruffle feathers. To get the public involved, the society set up a website where Canadians could vote for their favorite bird  โ€”   but it did not promise to heed the result. (Nobody wanted something like the โ€Boaty McBoatfaceโ€ online   debacle.) Instead, a panel of experts was given the final say. Prominent Canadian writers championed their favorites in the magazineโ€s pages, and the contest became a popular topic on (of course) Twitter under the hashtag #CanadaBird. The society even staged a public debate in September, with naturalists and Canadaโ€s poet laureate, George Elliott Clarke, each backing a species. And then came the big reveal. The proposed Canadian national bird would be   โ€ฆ     the gray jay. The what? Itโ€s a fluffy songbird found in all 13 of Canadaโ€s provinces and territories, which is a plus. But it tends to stick to the deep northern woods, and isnโ€t often seen as far south as the strip of land along the American border where most Canadians live. To them, the gray jay is a stranger. David Bird, a professor emeritus of wildlife biology and an ornithologist at McGill University in Montreal, was the birdโ€s booster in the debate. In an interview, Professor Bird gave a long list of reasons. For example, he said that instead of migrating, the gray jay stays in Canada and nests through the winter, feeding on frozen food that it stashed away in the fall under the loose bark of spruce trees. Mating pairs are monogamous, he said, unlike many other species. And gray jays like people when they meet them, alighting on their clothing or hands in the hope of a snack. โ€Youโ€ve got loyal, youโ€ve got friendly, youโ€ve got smart, youโ€ve got hearty: Thatโ€s what Canadians think we are,โ€ Professor Bird said. What you havenโ€t got is huge popularity. When about 50, 000 people voted in the magazineโ€s online poll, the gray jay finished third, behind the loon, which adorns Canadaโ€s   coin, and the snowy owl. โ€I know a lot of Canadians didnโ€t know what the gray jay was, and were asking: โ€Do I see it in my feeder? โ€โ€ Professor Bird said. โ€And there are still people angry because they felt the popular vote was not honored. โ€ Mr. Kylie, the editor of Canadian Geographic, said that the loon and snowy owl were excluded from final consideration because they were already used as symbols by the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. He said the relative unfamiliarity of the gray jay, also known as the whiskey jack, weighed on the plus side, not the minus. โ€We have an animal symbol, which is the beaver,โ€ he said by way of analogy. โ€I would say that most Canadians donโ€t see a beaver in a given year. The fact that some Canadians donโ€t know this bird, I think, is all the more reason to have it proclaimed the national bird. โ€ Then you have the spelling of the birdโ€s names. Following the usual Canadian style, it ought to be called the grey jay, with an e, or the whisky jack, without one. The โ€grayโ€ and โ€whiskeyโ€ spellings are seen (and resented) as Americanisms. The issue particularly vexes Dan Strickland, who began researching the bird as a graduate student at the Universitรฉ de Montrรฉal in late 1960s and continues to do so even after retiring as chief naturalist at Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario. The spellings, he said, come from the American Ornithologistsโ€ Union, which took it upon itself to determine official names for all the birds in North America. The union gave the species the Latin name Perisoreus canadensis, and at first, from 1886 to 1910, referred to it in English as the Canada jay. The union dropped all English bird names in 1910, but brought them back later, and the current ones stem from a sweeping revision of its naming system in 1957. Mr. Strickland, whose license plate reads GRAY JAY, said that if the government did adopt the bird as a symbol, it ought to legislate a Canadian name for it. โ€The bird is obviously a viable, valid contender to be the national bird,โ€ Mr. Strickland said. โ€But it is entirely inappropriate for the Canadian national bird to have a name imposed by a   foreign body. The A. O. U. can fall into line for once, or do whatever they want. But they do not get to name our national symbols. โ€ However you spell it, the magazineโ€s proposal has met with a cool reception from officialdom. โ€At this time, the government of Canada is not actively considering proposals to adopt a bird as a national symbol,โ€   Herbert, the press secretary for Mรฉlanie Joly, the heritage minister, wrote in an email. Even so, Professor Bird is among those now pushing to get a gray jay bill through Parliament somehow. And he expressed relief that another bird associated with Canada was never a real contender. โ€Canada goose? Over my dead body,โ€ he said. โ€Theyโ€re basically pooping machines, and theyโ€re obnoxious. If we had picked that bird, we would be getting a lot more outrage than we have now. โ€",0
118,Review: Beyoncรฉ Makes โ€Lemonadeโ€ Out of Marital Strife - The New York Times,Jon Pareles,"Marital strife smolders, explodes and uneasily subsides on โ€Lemonadeโ€ (Parkwood Entertainment) the album Beyoncรฉ   on Saturday night. โ€You can taste the  โ€s all over your breathโ€ are the first words she sings in โ€Pray You Catch Me,โ€ and thatโ€s just the beginning of an album that probes betrayal, jealousy, revenge and rage before dutifully willing itself toward reconciliation at the end. Many of the accusations are aimed specifically and recognizably at her husband, Shawn Carter, the rapper Jay Z. โ€Tonight I regret the night I put that ring on,โ€ she   in โ€Sorry,โ€ a twitchy, flippant song thatโ€s by no means an apology. Itโ€s a combative, unglossy track on an album full of them. โ€Lemonadeโ€ is the kind of album that a star like Beyoncรฉ (as well as, lately, Rihanna) can release in the streaming era because sheโ€s already guaranteed attention for her every utterance. The album is not beholden to radio formats or presold by a single fans are likely to explore the whole album, streaming every track and hearing how far afield  โ€”   a brass band, stomping   ultraslow    โ€”   Beyoncรฉ is willing to go. As she did with her 2013 album, โ€Beyoncรฉ,โ€ she has also paired the music with   video that expands and deepens its impact. On their own, the songs can be taken as one starโ€s personal, domestic dramas, waiting to be mined by the tabloids. But with the video, they testify to situations and emotions countless women endure. Itโ€s not a divorce announcement the singer, songwriter and director is credited as Beyoncรฉ Knowles Carter. Beyoncรฉ released โ€Lemonadeโ€ online at 10 p. m. on April 23, immediately after the HBO showing of the hourlong โ€visual albumโ€ version. Itโ€s a   music video that intersperses the songs, and broadens them, with compelling poetry from the   writer Warsan Shire, poems that often extend womenโ€s physicality toward the archetypal. As Beyoncรฉ recites them, Ms. Shireโ€s words radically reframe the songs, so they are no longer one womanโ€s struggles but tribulations shared through generations of mothers and daughters. The video is filled with images of female solidarity and of family, Southern and African roots, women of all ages and roles and eras. Often, Beyoncรฉ is joined by   women in white clothes enacting shared work, gatherings of women or eerie communal rituals. Beyoncรฉ, in multiple hairstyles and fashions, is shown both alluring and unglamorous:   unhappy, sweaty, harshly lit. For the last few songs she often appears in a     dress remade with fabric patterns derived from African textiles, a rich twist. The album title comes from a family gathering thatโ€s shown in the video and heard on a track: the 90th birthday of Hattie White, Jay Zโ€s grandmother, who says, โ€I was served lemons but I made lemonade. โ€ โ€Lemonadeโ€ is not necessarily the album listeners might have expected after โ€Formation,โ€ the song Beyoncรฉ performed at the Super Bowl with dancers in Black   outfits and in a video clip using images of New Orleans, of   in a plantation mansion and of Beyoncรฉ atop a police car, sinking under a flood. Itโ€s the last song on โ€Lemonade,โ€ almost a postscript itโ€s not in the extended video. One other song on โ€Lemonadeโ€ mixes preaching and a prison song (both collected by John and Alan Lomax) a Kendrick Lamar rap and 1960s   psychedelia (sampling the collectorsโ€ item Puerto Rican band Kaleidoscope) to call for โ€Freedomโ€: โ€I break chains all by  โ€t let my freedom rot in hell,โ€ Beyoncรฉ vows. But most of โ€Lemonadeโ€ arrives like a   to โ€Jealousโ€ on the 2013 โ€Beyoncรฉ,โ€ a song that moans, โ€I hate you for your lies. โ€ โ€Jealousโ€ is offset on โ€Beyoncรฉโ€ by songs about ecstatic lust, a topic largely absent on โ€Lemonade. โ€ In most of the new songs, Beyoncรฉ has been taken for granted or pushed aside. Itโ€s a situation that, she finds, is both โ€a wicked way to treat the girl that loves youโ€ and also flabbergasting given that she is, after all, Beyoncรฉ. Beyoncรฉ!: โ€The baddest woman in the game,โ€ as she sings in โ€Hold Up. โ€  : She is. Her reactions swing from sorrow to rage to determined loyalty, and she reaches beyond the   of โ€Beyoncรฉโ€ to embrace new influences and collaborators: the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Father John Misty, Vampire Weekendโ€s Ezra Koenig, Animal Collective and Led Zeppelin. โ€Donโ€t Hurt Yourself,โ€ a collaboration with Jack White, is a     that has Beyoncรฉ fighting back, declaring, โ€You ainโ€t trying hard   ainโ€t loving hard enough,โ€ working up to a scream. โ€Pray You Catch Meโ€ is one of two collaborations with the British songwriter James Blake:   ballads of suspicion and longing. During โ€Forward,โ€ the other Blake collaboration, the video has its most moving sequence: family members stoically holding photographs of men who were killed by police. Itโ€s followed by a scene of a New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian in full feathered and beaded costume, shaking a tambourine in posh dining rooms as if to exorcise them. Yet eventually, she makes peace with trying to hold on. โ€Love Drought,โ€ with whispery vocals amid pillowy synthesizers, points out that โ€10 times out of nine I know youโ€re lying,โ€ but strives to reconnect. โ€Sandcastles,โ€ a slow piano hymn that eventually gathers a choir, recalls a   fight but turns a double negative into a positive: โ€I know I promised that I couldnโ€t stay,   promise donโ€t work out that way. โ€ By the time Beyoncรฉ reaches โ€All Night,โ€ a gospelly ballad roughened with electric guitar, she resolves to โ€Give you some time to prove I can trust you again. โ€ Will it work out? No one knows. But in the meantime she sings wholeheartedly, encapsulates deep dilemmas in terse singalong lines and touches on ideas and emotions that so many people feel. She is a star whose world is vastly different from that of her listeners. But in matters of the heart, with their complications and paradoxes, Beyoncรฉ joins all of us.",0
119,"Trump to Ask for Sharp Increases in Military Spending, Officials Say - The New York Times","Glenn Thrush, Kate Kelly and Maggie Haberman","WASHINGTON  โ€”   President Trump will instruct federal agencies on Monday to assemble a budget for the coming fiscal year that includes sharp increases in Defense Department spending and drastic enough cuts to domestic agencies that he can keep his promise to leave Social Security and Medicare alone, according to four senior administration officials. The budget outline will be the first move in a campaign this week to reset the narrative of Mr. Trumpโ€s   White House. A day before delivering a   address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump will demand a budget with tens of billions of dollars in reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department, according to four senior administration officials with direct knowledge of the plan. Social safety net programs, aside from the big entitlement programs for retirees, would also be hit hard. Preliminary budget outlines are usually   administrative exercises, the first step in negotiations between the White House and federal agencies that usually shave the sharpest edges off the initial request. But this plan  โ€”   a product of a collaboration between the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney the National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn and the White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  โ€”   is intended to make a big splash for a president eager to show that he is a man of action. Mr. Trumpโ€s top advisers huddled in the White House this weekend to work on his Tuesday night   address. They focused on a single, often overlooked message amid the chaos of his first weeks in the White House: the assertion that the   candidate is now a president determined to keep audacious campaign promises on immigration, the economy and the budget, no matter how sloppy or disruptive it looks from the outside. โ€They might not agree with everything you do, but people will respect you for doing what you said you were going to do,โ€ said Jason Miller, a top communications strategist on the Trump campaign who remains close to the White House. โ€Heโ€s doing something first, and thereโ€s time for talk later,โ€ Mr. Miller added. โ€This is ultimately how heโ€s going to get people who didnโ€t vote, or people who didnโ€t vote for him, into the fold. Inside the Beltway and with the media, thereโ€s this focus on the palace intrigue. Out in the rest of the country, they are seeing a guy who is focused on jobs and the economy. โ€ The budget plan, a numerical sketch that will probably be substantially altered by House and Senate Republicans  โ€”   and vociferously opposed by congressional Democrats  โ€”   will be Mr. Trumpโ€s first big step into a legislative fray he has largely avoided during the first 40 days of his administration. Thus far, instead of legislating, he has focused on a succession of executive orders on immigration and deregulation written by Mr. Bannonโ€s small West Wing team. Resistance from federal agencies could ease some of the deepest cuts in the initial plan before a final budget request is even sent to Congress. And Capitol Hill will have the last word. To meet Mr. Trumpโ€s defense request, lawmakers in both parties would have to agree to raise or end statutory spending caps on defense and domestic programs that were imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Mr. Trump is in a highly unusual position at a time when most presidents are finding their footing or confronting crisis. Despite his lament that he was handed โ€a messโ€ by President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump inherited a low unemployment rate, a lack of international crises requiring immediate attention and majorities in both houses of Congress. By contrast, when Mr. Obama took office, the country was losing 700, 000 jobs a month, and the global financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse. By the time he stepped up to the rostrum for his first joint congressional address on Feb. 24, 2009, he had already accrued an impressive string of accomplishments, including the passage of a massive stimulus bill through the   Congress, a gender   act, a childrenโ€s health insurance law and executive actions that would ultimately help stabilize the financial and automotive sectors. With the prospect of a second Great Depression still high, Mr. Obama sought to rally the country, vowing, โ€We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before. โ€ Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who was Mr. Obamaโ€s first chief of staff, said in an interview Sunday night that Mr. Trump was trying to create a โ€sense of urgency, which most people arenโ€t feeling right now, which was a reality to usโ€ in order to generate support for his unspecified economic agenda, including an infrastructure bill and a tax overhaul. โ€When it comes to all of these executive orders, the question is, does the public view what heโ€s doing as action or motion?โ€ Mr. Emanuel added. โ€If you donโ€t have real action, you create a sense of motion, so the public views it as progress. โ€ In putting together their budget plans, White House officials are operating under the assumption that the rate of the United Statesโ€ economic growth this year will be 2. 4 percent, according to one person who has been briefed on the matter. That is slightly ahead of current projections, but it is well below the 3 percent to 4 percent growth that Mr. Trump promised during the campaign. For next year, the operating assumption is only slightly higher, that person added, a sign that the budget process will not be too out of step with economic reality. The turmoil that has engulfed Mr. Trumpโ€s West Wing is largely of his own devising  โ€”   part of a calculated effort by Mr. Bannon to move boldly despite his teamโ€s lack of experience, and despite the reluctance of many mainstream Republicans to work for a president whom many of them opposed in the partyโ€s brutal primaries. โ€During his first month in office, President Trump has done exactly what he said he was going to do,โ€ said Thomas Barrack Jr. a longtime friend of Mr. Trumpโ€s who ran his inaugural committee. โ€No president has worked harder or accomplished as much, even with tremendous political resistance forcing him to operate with a small team of outsiders possessing little government experience. โ€ Lawmakers in both parties have complained that the presidentโ€s big words are not yet matched by detailed policy prescriptions or a legislative affairs team capable of executing such undefined promises as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or rewriting the tax code. The budget outline will give Mr. Trump an opportunity to add some specifics to an agenda that has been defined by bellicose speech and the broadest possible policy strokes. Still, aides said Mr. Trump did not plan to change his style for Tuesdayโ€s address. The speech, they said, is likely to have more in common with his clipped inaugural address  โ€”   in which he declared, โ€The time for empty talk is overโ€  โ€”   than the   litanies of policy proposals favored by President Bill Clinton or the   invocations of national purpose preferred by President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama. Mr. Trumpโ€s team, conscious of his recent reversals and a   approval rating that is among the lowest ever recorded, has emphasized his determination to break the partisan gridlock and inaction that has kept congressional approval ratings in the 15 to 30 percent range for years. At the start of an interview last week with Sean Hannity of Fox News at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Kellyanne Conway, the presidentโ€s counselor, called him โ€President Action, President Impact, Donald J. Trump. โ€ In a   of Sunday show interviews, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trumpโ€s policy adviser, maintained that the president had accomplished more in his first month than most of his predecessors had in their entire administrations. In reality, most of Mr. Trumpโ€s executive actions have had no more effect on actual policy than news releases. And his     order on the   Partnership trade deal came well after the agreement had been put on life support by labor protests and liberal opposition. One West Wing official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about strategy, said the administration craved the   television images of Mr. Trump at   discussions with business executives every few days on one side, and the vehement protesters of his administration on the other. But his critics say such photo opportunities are all an act, a      rendition of โ€The Apprenticeโ€ by an ineffective rookie president. โ€This man is not a doer,โ€ said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, who will host a Monday โ€ โ€ of Mr. Trumpโ€s Tuesday speech. โ€Oh, please. He has nothing to show for what heโ€s been doing in office for 40 days. Itโ€s all been squandered. โ€",0

121,Why Is This Not Watergate? Smoking Gun Emails Discuss โ€Cleaning Upโ€ Obama/Hillary Emails,Contributing Author,"
This article was written by Tyler Durden and originally published at Zero Hedge . 
Editorโ€s Comment: Of course everyone knew, deep down, that Obama was fully aware of Hillaryโ€s private emails, but now there is proof that the campaigns sought to cover up and clean up the evidence to it. Team Hillary went so far as to use bleach bit, a ridiculously thorough way of erasing oneโ€s digital footprint. Before she even takes office, she is embroiled in a scandal many magnitudes bigger than Watergateโ€ฆ and yetโ€ฆ nothing. 
No one falls on their sword; no one drops out; no one is held accountable. It seems that โ€Teflonโ€ will out-survive even the cockroaches and nuclear warsโ€ฆ 
Can all the media spin and vote rigging really hold all this together? Can the FBI get away with looking the other way, and still pretend to uphold a nation of laws? Will the American people accept her โ€victoryโ€ and go on about their daily lives? 
The Smoking Gun: Cheryl Mills Tells Podesta โ€We Need To Clean This Up โ€“ Obama Has Emails From Herโ€ 
by Tyler Durden
Recall that in a March 2015 interview with CBS, just after the NYT reported of Hillaryโ€s use of a private email server, president Obama told the American public he had only learned about Hillaryโ€s โ€unusualโ€ arrangement from the press.
As we further reminded readers one month ago, CBS News senior White House correspondent Bill Plante asked Mr. Obama when he learned about her private email system after his Saturday appearance in Selma, Alabama. โ€ The same time everybody else learned it through news reports ,โ€ the president told Plante. โ€ The policy of my administration is to encourage transparency, which is why my emails, the BlackBerry I carry around, all those records are available and archived ,โ€ Mr. Obama said. โ€Iโ€m glad that Hillaryโ€s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed.โ€

Unfortunately, the โ€transparencyโ€ of the Obama administration was severely tarnished in late September , when in the FBIโ€s interview notes with Huma Abedin released by the FBI it was first revealed that Obama had used a pseudonymous email account: โ€Once informed that the senderโ€s name is believed to be pseudonym used by the president, Abedin exclaimed: โ€How is this not classified?'โ€ the report says. โ€Abedin then expressed her amazement at the presidentโ€s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.โ€
To be sure, this was not definitive evidence that Obama was aware of Hillaryโ€s email server, nor that there may have been collusion between the president and the Clinton campaign.
That changed today, however, when in the latest Podesta dump we learn that in an email from Cheryl Mills to John Podesta, the Clinton aide upon learning what Obama had just saidโ€ฆ
I have some questions here pic.twitter.com/ufkeoZCx2m 
โ€” Katherine Miller (@katherinemiller) March 7, 2015 

โ€ฆ countered with something quite stunning:
we need to clean this up โ€“ he has emails from her โ€“ they do not say state.gov That, ladies and gentlemen, is proof that the president not only lied, but did so with the clear intention of protecting the Clinton campaign.

As a further reminder, Politico previously reported that the State Department had refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama. Lawyers cited the โ€presidential communications privilege,โ€ a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act. It is therefore unknown what the presidentโ€s โ€alternativeโ€ email account was, or who hosted it.
This also explains why in a prior Wikileak, Podesta told Mills in an email titled โ€Special Categoryโ€ that she thinks โ€ we should hold emails to and from potus? Thatโ€s the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I(t) seems like they will. โ€ Mills did not respond by email.
The Clinton-Obama emails were turned over to the State Department, which later announced it would not release them.
* * *
So just how did Mills and Podesta โ€clean upโ€ the fact that Obama lied to the American people, a tactic some could allege is evidence of an attempt to cover up a presidential lie to protect Hillary Clinton.
What we do know, and we assume this is completely unrelated, between March 25-31, just a couple of weeks after Mills said โ€we need to clean this up,โ€ Bleachbit was used to wipe Hillaryโ€s private server clean. But of course, that is purely a coincidence.
Since we are confident others will also demand an answer, in light of the latest revelation hinting at a collusive cover up extending to the very top of US government, or as Cheryl Mills dubbed it a โ€clean upโ€, perhaps it is time for the State Department to unveil just what was said between the president and the Clinton campaign?

122,โ€Chapo Trap Houseโ€: New Left-Wing Podcast is a Flagrant Rip-Off of The Right Stuff,Eric Striker,"โ€Chapo Trap Houseโ€: New Left-Wing Podcast is a Flagrant Rip-Off of The Right Stuff 
Eric Striker October 27, 2016 These fags here. 
Last March, a group of Williamsburg trust fund Bernie bros started a podcast called โ€ Chapo Trap House .โ€ร The humor style and format of Chapo Trap House content is a left-wing carbon copy of the types of radio shows produced by Alt-Right sensation The Right Stuff , particularly the Daily Shoah, which uses Opie & Anthony style gags and parodies as a vehicle for delivering our counter-cultural and suppressed ideas. 
CTH is trying to invert our ideas, bubble wrap the edges, and use our effective models to try and make Leftism โ€“ an ideology that we have exposed and mocked into increasing irrelevance โ€“โ€coolโ€ by fixing some sunglasses to hide a weak (when put to reason) ideology. 
They have a small troll army on social media, they do (admittedly good) voice impressions, our Counter-Semitic tropes (at least one of the three is Jewish) are replaced by mocking working class White people and Christians, they have memes, albeit even more forced than Dat Boi , they make watered down attempts to pull down some high-profile liberal figures (like we do conservatives). They like to name drop famous comedians like Trevor Moore (of โ€ Whitest Kids U Know โ€ fame) as personal friends and have fairly high profile Leftist guests, which makes me think they have professional training or friends in high places. 
Oh, and they spend most of their time attacking the Alt-Right, replacing cuck (our term for them) with โ€incel,โ€ while demonstratingร extensive knowledge of external elements of our counter-culture. Theyโ€re obviously very familiar with us, and are trying to create an audience by claiming theyโ€re the real rebels and bomb throwers. Trying to rip-off meme magic 
Yet, their Patreon is flush with cash (way out of proportion to their average plays, i.e. they have big money donors relative to our camp), their Soundcloud and social media pages arenโ€t muzzled like ours, thereโ€s nobody trying to silence them or shut them down. They can do stuff under their full names, yet mysteriously, their capitalist bosses wonโ€t fire or black list them for calling for the death of capitalists. They get invited to do live performances in some of the Jewiest, most โ€prestigious,โ€ high rolling and trendy venues in NYC. 
Unlike the Daily Stormer, the Right Stuff or Ricky Vaughn (who they constantly reference with typical Seattle bourgeois shit-lib snark), they can say and do whatever they want because big capital and the American plutocracy is, at the very least, behind the core of their worldview (open borders, amalgamation of cultures and races, feminism). 
Chapo Trap Houseโ€s podcast is fairly new, yet already attracting positive attention from our elites. In their defense, they are critical of Hillary Clinton, yet establishment Judeo-Left individuals and institutions, from the Hillary gun-runners at Mediate to Jeet Heer, have commented quite positively on the show. Compared to TRS, they are getting quite a bit of very friendly publicity as a form of reaction to the rise of the Alt-Right. 
But this podcast has no natural audience. So who is it for? 
Most of the blacks and browns who stand on top of the two White male goyim cis maleโ€s in the progressive stack would sucker punch these private school kids who only know what niggers are in theory and steal their iPhones if they had the chance. As for the obese feminists with magenta bowl cuts, they would curl-up into a ball and wail like banshees from all of the micro aggressions these three directly and indirectly engage in. The queers, pedos, trannies, and whatever other group of mentally ill perverts front and center as moral arbitrators of the modern Judeo-Left would distrust them for their pathology of enjoying sexual intercourse with women. Last and not least, most leftists in the West today are humorless, moralistic mental midgets. 
The real purpose of CTH is to staunch the bleeding of young and normal White males coming into our camp in droves right now. By using methods we have proven to resonate with this demographic, they hope to try and sell a state-sanctioned ideology whose only natural endpoint is basically the extermination of us and our families, but with an edgy veneer. This has been done in a different form in the past, it is similar to what the Sony contracted, MTV promoted millionaires in Rage Against the Machine did in the 90โ€s: plastic revolution in the name of art that isnโ€t actually revolutionary. 
I , Eric Striker, am calling out Chapo Trap House to have an unedited debate and exchange of ideas with me on their show. Guys on our side are always interviewing and inviting Leftists on our programs and websites, if they have faith in their ideas letโ€s see them put their parentsโ€ money where their mouth is. 
The Judeo-Left fears free and open discourse due to the inherent weakness of their philosophy. 
Letโ€s convince them:",1
123,Taiwan Responds After China Sends Carrier to Taiwan Strait - The New York Times,Michael Forsythe and Chris Buckley,"HONG KONG  โ€”   Taiwan scrambled   fighter jets and dispatched a frigate to the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday after China sent its sole aircraft carrier into the waterway, Taiwanโ€s official Central News Agency reported. The transit of the aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, came amid rising tensions between Taiwan and China after   Donald J. Trump broke decades of protocol by speaking on the phone with Taiwanโ€s president, Tsai   after his election victory. Ms. Tsai leads a political party that has traditionally supported Taiwanโ€s formal independence from China. Ms. Tsai, who is visiting Central America this week, made two calls to officials in Taiwan seeking updates on the Liaoningโ€s transit, the Central News Agency reported, citing Alex Huang, the presidentโ€s spokesman. Chinaโ€s decision to send the carrier through the waterway that separates it from Taiwan reflects an early foreign policy challenge for Mr. Trump. โ€Itโ€s a show of force, and I think it is intended in part to intimidate, and thatโ€s worrisome from the U. S. and Taiwanโ€s point of view because we donโ€t know how much more they are going to ratchet up these pressures and tensions,โ€ said Bonnie S. Glaser, senior adviser for Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. โ€If the Trump administration does see this as a test of U. S. resolve, I suspect theyโ€ll push back pretty forcefully. โ€ China sent the carrier, which had been conducting exercises in the South China Sea, into the Taiwan Strait on Wednesday morning. Taiwanโ€s response was the third time in three days that air forces in the region had scrambled jets in response to Chinese military activity, after Japan and South Korea deployed fighters on Monday. Those actions occurred when a squadron of six Chinese bombers and two other aircraft flew over the waters that separate Japan and South Korea and over the Sea of Japan. Taiwan, considered by Beijing to be Chinese territory, has been governed separately since 1949, when the forces of the Nationalist leader Chiang   fled to the island after their defeat on the mainland by the Communists. China views any assertion of Taiwanโ€s separateness from the mainland  โ€”   like Ms. Tsaiโ€s call with Mr. Trump  โ€”   as an affront to its claim of sovereignty. Since 1979, the United States has recognized the government in Beijing and broke off formal diplomatic ties to Taiwan as part of the One China policy. In the wake of the   call, China warned the incoming president against making changes to that policy after he takes office on Jan. 20. Liu Zhenmin, a Chinese vice foreign minister, said on Wednesday that the Taiwan Strait was an international waterway and that it was normal for the Liaoning to pass though it. The passage would not have any effect on   relations, he said in remarks carried in the Chinese news media. Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman, told reporters in Washington in response to a question about the Liaoningโ€s passage through the strait that the United States โ€wouldnโ€t have a problemโ€ with countries sailing their vessels in international waters as long as it was done in accordance with international law. It also was not the first time the Liaoning had sailed through the strait: It passed through in November 2013 on its way to the South China Sea after having been commissioned only the year before. In that instance, the carrier kept to the western half of the strait, closer to mainland China. In a statement on Wednesday morning, Taiwanโ€s Defense Ministry said that the Liaoning was also staying to the west of the straitโ€s middle and urged citizens to remain calm. A transit on the eastern side, closer to Taiwan, would be viewed as much more provocative. Euan Graham, the director of the International Security Program at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, Australia, said that for the Chinese, traveling through the strait was a logical way to move from one area of fleet operations to another along its long coastline. In order for warships based in northern ports, like the Liaoning, to return home from southern waters, they must either pass close to Japanese islands or transit the Taiwan Strait. โ€Geography forces a very binary choice,โ€ he said. Mr. Graham said it was important to see how the Liaoning conducted its passage. If it had aircraft on deck and was conducting flight operations, that would be seen as more provocative than if it passed through the strait with the aircraft in its hangar bay, he said. The Liaoning, commissioned in 2012 and built from a Soviet hull, is Chinaโ€s first aircraft carrier. In past decades, the United States has shown its resolve to defend Taiwan by sailing carriers through the Taiwan Strait. In 1995, the aircraft carrier Nimitz transited the strait amid heightened tensions after Beijing conducted missile exercises in the waters. Chinaโ€s military   is highly secretive, but it would seem inconceivable for the Liaoning to pass through such contested waters without approval from the president, Xi Jinping, who is also the chairman of the Central Military Commission, which controls the military. And the Chinese military media has described the aircraft carrier as embodying Mr. Xiโ€s plans for a stronger navy, capable of projecting force far beyond Chinaโ€s territorial waters. Last Thursday, the front page of Peopleโ€s Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese military, featured a report about the aircraft carrierโ€s latest journey under the headline, โ€Weโ€re sailing under the leaderโ€s attentive gaze,โ€ a clear tribute to Mr. Xi. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, said in a news conference on Wednesday that the Liaoningโ€s passage was part of the shipโ€s scheduled training in the western Pacific, which had begun on Dec. 24. Mr. Ma also said that the   relationship in the coming year would face โ€increasing uncertainty, looming risks and challenges. โ€ He added that Taiwanโ€s government and โ€independence forcesโ€ there had โ€seriously threatened the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait,โ€ accusing them of engaging in separatist activities and warning that China would โ€resolutely safeguard its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. โ€ The aircraft carrierโ€s passage was part of a cluster of recent acts by the Chinese military that have raised hackles in the region. Last month, a Chinese warship seized an underwater drone belonging to the United States Navy about 50 miles northwest of Subic Bay in the Philippines. The drone was returned after the Obama administration publicly chided China over the seizure. On Monday, Japan said it had sent fighter jets into the air after Chinese bombers and surveillance planes flew over the East China Sea and the Sea of Japan. โ€When China was militarily weaker, Japan considered that area to be its backyard,โ€ said Ni Lexiong, a naval affairs researcher at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. โ€This was a way of telling Japan that if there ever is conflict, the location of any future battle space wonโ€t be decided by you and America. We have the initiative. So Japan, donโ€t think of meddling further afield in Taiwan or the South China Sea. โ€",0

126,Explosive Assange/Pilger Interview on US Election: Expect Riots if Hillary Wins,wmw_admin,"By wmw_admin on November 6, 2016 Darkmoon โ€” Nov 6, 2016 RT : โ€Whistleblower Julian Assange has given one of his most incendiary interviews ever in a John Pilger Special [released late yesterday] courtesy of Dartmouth Films. Here he summarizes what can be gleaned from the tens of thousands of Clinton emails leaked by WikiLeaks this year.โ€ LD : Despite the enormous populist support for Trump and the extraordinary loathing in which Hillary Clinton is held by millions of American, Assange says that โ€Trump cannot be allowed to win.โ€ Trump has already indicated that he will not recognize the result of the election if he loses, given the enormous enthusiasm he has generated during his speeches, compared to the relatively tepid and anaemic response evoked by Hillary Clinton on similar occasions. Recent news reports reveal that โ€election related violence is increasing and Right-wing armed militia groups are even preparing for unrest if Mrs Clinton โ€stealsโ€ the election, as they fear will happen.โ€ If Hillary Clinton wins this election, as Assange predicts, we can expect riots to erupt all across America. Violent insurrection, in the circumstances of a rigged election, would appear to be more than justified. Hillary Clinton clearly belongs behind bars, not in the White House. [LD] John Pilger (left) conducted the 25-minute interview at the Ecuadorian Embassy where Assange has been trapped since 2012 for fear of extradition to the US. Here is a transcript of the interview followed by the YouTube interview itself. Click to enlarge THE SECRET WORLD OF THE US ELECTION John Pilger: Whatโ€s the significance of the FBIโ€s intervention in these last days of the U.S. election campaign, in the case against Hillary Clinton? Julian Assange: If you look at the history of the FBI, it has become effectively Americaโ€s political police. The FBI demonstrated this by taking down the former head of the CIA General David Petraeus over classified information given to his mistress. Almost no-one is untouchable. The FBI is always trying to demonstrate that no-one can resist us. But Hillary Clinton very conspicuously resisted the FBIโ€s investigation, so thereโ€s anger within the FBI because it made the FBI look weak. Weโ€ve published about 33,000 of Clintonโ€s emails when she was Secretary of State. They come from a batch of just over 60,000 emails, [of which] Clinton has kept about half โ€” 30,000 โ€” to herself, and weโ€ve published about half. Then there are the Podesta emails weโ€ve been publishing. John Podesta is Hillary Clintonโ€s primary campaign manager, so thereโ€s a thread that runs through all these emails; there are quite a lot of pay-for-play, as they call it, giving access in exchange for money to states, individuals and corporations. These emails are combined with the cover up of the Hillary Clinton emails when she was Secretary of State, which has led to an environment where the pressure on the FBI increases. โ€Russian government not the source of Clinton leaksโ€ PILGER : The Clinton campaign has said that Russia is behind all of this, that Russia has manipulated the campaign and is the source for WikiLeaks and its emails. ASSANGE : The Clinton camp has been able to project that kind of neo-McCarthy hysteria: that Russia is responsible for everything. Hilary Clinton stated multiple times, falsely, that seventeen U.S. intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our publications. That is false; we can say that the Russian government is not the source. โ€Saudi Arabia & Qatar funding ISIS and Clintonโ€ PILGER : The emails that give evidence of access for money and how Hillary Clinton herself benefited from this and how she is benefitting politically, are quite extraordinary. Iโ€m thinking of when the Qatari representative was given five minutes with Bill Clinton for a million dollar cheque. ASSANGE : And twelve million dollars from Morocco โ€ฆ PILGER : Twelve million from Morocco, yeah. ASSANGE : For Hillary Clinton to attend a party. PILGER : In terms of the foreign policy of the United States, thatโ€s where the emails are most revealing, where they show the direct connection between Hillary Clinton and the foundation of jihadism, of ISIL, in the Middle East. Can you talk about how the emails demonstrate the connection between those who are meant to be fighting the jihadists of ISIL, are actually those who have helped create it. ASSANGE : Thereโ€s an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation. Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well itโ€s just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. PILGER : The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the Saudis and the Qataris, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation while Hilary Clinton is Secretary of State and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly to Saudi Arabia. ASSANGE : Under Hillary Clinton, the worldโ€s largest ever arms deal was made with Saudi Arabia, worth more than $80 billion. In fact, during her tenure as Secretary of State, total arms exports from the United States in terms of the dollar value, doubled. PILGER : Of course the consequence of that is that the notorious terrorist group called ISIl or ISIS is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation. ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : Thatโ€s extraordinary. โ€Clinton has been eaten alive by her ambitionโ€ ASSANGE : I actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick; they faint as a result of the reaction to their ambitions. She represents a whole network of people and a network of relationships with particular states. The question is how does Hilary Clinton fit in this broader network? Sheโ€s a centralising cog. Youโ€ve got a lot of different gears in operation from the big banks like Goldman Sachs and major elements of Wall Street, and Intelligence and people in the State Department and the Saudis. Sheโ€s the centraliser that inter-connects all these different cogs. Sheโ€s the smooth central representation of all that, and โ€all thatโ€ is more or less what is in power now in the United States. Itโ€s what we call the establishment or the DC consensus. One of the more significant Podesta emails that we released was about how the Obama cabinet was formed and how half the Obama cabinet was basically nominated by a representative from City Bank. This is quite amazing. PILGER : Didnโ€t Citybank supply a listโ€ฆ ? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : Which turned out to be most of the Obama cabinet? ASSANGE : Yes. PILGER : So Wall Street decides the cabinet of the President of the United States? ASSANGE : If you were following the Obama campaign back then, closely, you could see it had become very close to banking interests. So I think you canโ€t properly understand Hillary Clintonโ€s foreign policy without understanding Saudi Arabia. The connections with Saudi Arabia are so intimate. โ€Libya is Hillary Clintonโ€s warโ€ PILGER : Why was she so demonstrably enthusiastic about the destruction of Libya? Can you talk a little about just what the emails have told us โ€“ told you โ€“ about what happened there? Because Libya is such a source for so much of the mayhem now in Syria: the ISIL, jihadism, and so on. And it was almost Hillary Clintonโ€s invasion. What do the emails tell us about that? ASSANGE : Libya, more than anyone elseโ€s war, was Hillary Clintonโ€s war. Barak Obama initially opposed it. Who was the person championing it? Hillary Clinton. Thatโ€s documented throughout her emails. She had put her favoured agent, Sidney Blumenthal, on to that; thereโ€s more than 1700 emails out of the thirty three thousand Hillary Clinton emails that weโ€ve published, just about Libya. Itโ€s not that Libya has cheap oil. She perceived the removal of Gaddafi and the overthrow of the Libyan state โ€” something that she would use in her run-up to the general election for President. So in late 2011 there is an internal document called the Libya Tick Tock that was produced for Hillary Clinton, and itโ€s the chronological description of how she was the central figure in the destruction of the Libyan state, which resulted in around 40,000 deaths within Libya; jihadists moved in, ISIS moved in, leading to the European refugee and migrant crisis. Not only did you have people fleeing Libya, people fleeing Syria, the destabilisation of other African countries as a result of arms flows, but the Libyan state itself err was no longer able to control the movement of people through it. Libya faces along to the Mediterranean and had been effectively the cork in the bottle of Africa. So all problems, economic problems and civil war in Africa โ€” previously people fleeing those problems didnโ€t end up in Europe because Libya policed the Mediterranean. That was said explicitly at the time, back in early 2011 by Gaddafi: โ€What do these Europeans think theyโ€re doing, trying to bomb and destroy the Libyan State? Thereโ€s going to be floods of migrants out of Africa and jihadists into Europe, and this is exactly what happened. โ€Trump wonโ€t be permitted to winโ€ PILGER : You get complaints from people saying, โ€What is WikiLeaks doing? Are they trying to put Trump in the White House?โ€ ASSANGE : My answer is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because heโ€s had every establishment off side; Trump doesnโ€t have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them an establishment, but banks, intelligence agencies, arms companiesโ€ฆ big foreign money โ€ฆ are all united behind Hillary Clinton, and the media as well, media owners and even journalists themselves. PILGER : There is the accusation that WikiLeaks is in league with the Russians. Some people say, โ€Well, why doesnโ€t WikiLeaks investigate and publish emails on Russia?โ€ ASSANGE : We have published about 800,000 documents of various kinds that relate to Russia. Most of those are critical; and a great many books have come out of our publications about Russia, most of which are critical. Our Russia documents have gone on to be used in quite a number of court cases: refugee cases of people fleeing some kind of claimed political persecution in Russia, which they use our documents to back up. PILGER : Do you yourself take a view of the U.S. election? Do you have a preference for Clinton or Trump? ASSANGE : Letโ€s talk about Donald Trump. What does he represent in the American mind and in the European mind? He represents American white trash, which Hillary Clinton called โ€deplorable and irredeemableโ€. It means from an establishment or educated cosmopolitan, urbane perspective, these people are like the red necks, and you can never deal with them. Because he so clearly โ€” through his words and actions and the type of people that turn up at his rallies โ€” represents people who are not the middle, not the upper middle educated class, there is a fear of seeming to be associated in any way with them, a social fear that lowers the class status of anyone who can be accused of somehow assisting Trump in any way, including any criticism of Hillary Clinton. If you look at how the middle class gains its economic and social power, that makes absolute sense. โ€US attempting to squeeze WikiLeaks through my refugee statusโ€ PILGER : Iโ€d like to talk about Ecuador, the small country that has given you refuge and political asylum in this embassy in London. Now Ecuador has cut off the internet from here where weโ€re doing this interview, in the Embassy, for the clearly obvious reason that they are concerned about appearing to intervene in the U.S. election campaign. Can you talk about why they would take that action and your own views on Ecuadorโ€s support for you? ASSANGE : Letโ€s let go back four years. I made an asylum application to Ecuador in this embassy, because of the U.S. extradition case, and the result was that after a month, I was successful in my asylum application. The embassy since then has been surrounded by police: quite an expensive police operation which the British government admits to spending more than ยฃ12.6 million. They admitted that over a year ago. Now thereโ€s undercover police and there are robot surveillance cameras of various kinds โ€” so that there has been quite a serious conflict right here in the heart of London between Ecuador, a country of sixteen million people, and the United Kingdom, and the Americans who have been helping on the side. So that was a brave and principled thing for Ecuador to do. Now we have the U.S. election campaign, the Ecuadorian election is in February next year, and you have the White House feeling the political heat as a result of the true information that we have been publishing. WikiLeaks does not publish from the jurisdiction of Ecuador, from this embassy or in the territory of Ecuador; we publish from France, we publish from, from Germany, we publish from The Netherlands and from a number of other countries, so that the attempted squeeze on WikiLeaks is through my refugee status; and this is, this is really intolerable. It means that [they] are trying to get at a publishing organisation; they try and prevent it from publishing true information that is of intense interest to the American people and others about an election. PILGER : Tell us what would happen if you walked out of this embassy. ASSANGE : I would be immediately arrested by the British police and I would then be extradited either immediately to the United States or to Sweden. In Sweden I am not charged, I have already been previously cleared by the Senior Stockholm Prosecutor Eva Finne. We were not certain exactly what would happen there, but then we know that the Swedish government has refused to say that they will not extradite me to the United States we know they have extradited 100 per cent of people whom the U.S. has requested since at least 2000. So over the last fifteen years, every single person the U.S. has tried to extradite from Sweden has been extradited, and they refuse to provide a guarantee [that wonโ€t happen]. PILGER : People often ask me how you cope with the isolation in here. ASSANGE : Look, one of the best attributes of human beings is that theyโ€re adaptable; one of the worst attributes of human beings is they are adaptable. They adapt and start to tolerate abuses, they adapt to being involved themselves in abuses, they adapt to adversity and they continue on. So in my situation, frankly, Iโ€m a bit institutionalised โ€” this [the embassy] is the world โ€ฆ itโ€s visually the world for me. PILGER : Itโ€s the world without sunlight, for one thing, isnโ€t it? ASSANGE : Itโ€s the world without sunlight, but I havenโ€t seen sunlight in so long, I donโ€t remember it. PILGER : Yes. ASSANGE : So , yes, you adapt. The one real irritant is that my young children โ€” they also adapt. They adapt to being without their father. Thatโ€s a hard, hard adaption which they didnโ€t ask for. PILGER : Do you worry about them? ASSANGE : Yes, I worry about them; I worry about their mother. โ€I am innocent and in arbitrary detentionโ€ PILGER : Some people would say, โ€Well, why donโ€t you end it and simply walk out the door and allow yourself to be extradited to Sweden?โ€ ASSANGE : The U.N. [the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention] has looked into this whole situation. They spent eighteen months in formal, adversarial litigation. So itโ€s me and the U.N. verses Sweden and the U.K. Whoโ€s right? The U.N. made a conclusion that I am being arbitrarily detained illegally, deprived of my freedom and that what has occurred has not occurred within the laws that the United Kingdom and Sweden, and that those countries must obey. It is an illegal abuse. It is the United Nations formally asking, โ€Whatโ€s going on here? What is your legal explanation for this? Assange says that you should recognise his asylum.โ€ And here is. Sweden formally writing back to the United Nations to say, โ€No, weโ€re not going to recognise the UN ruling, so leaving open their ability to extradite. I just find it absolutely amazing that the narrative about this situation is not put out publically in the press, because it doesnโ€t suit the Western establishment narrative โ€” that yes, the West has political prisoners, itโ€s a reality, itโ€s not just me, thereโ€s a bunch of other people as well. The West has political prisoners. Of course, no state accepts that it should call the people it is imprisoning or detaining for political reasons, political prisoners. They donโ€t call them political prisoners in China, they donโ€t call them political prisoners in Azerbaijan and they donโ€t call them political prisoners in the United States, U.K. or Sweden; it is absolutely intolerable to have that kind of self-perception. ASSANGE : Here we have a case, the Swedish case, where I have never been charged with a crime, where I have already been cleared by the Stockholm prosecutor and found to be innocent, where the woman herself said that the police made it up, where the United Nations formally said the whole thing is illegal, where the State of Ecuador also investigated and found that I should be given asylum. Those are the facts, but what is the rhetoric? PILGER : Yes, itโ€s different. ASSANGE : The rhetoric is pretending, constantly pretending that I have been charged with a crime, and never mentioning that I have been already previously cleared, never mentioning that the woman herself says that the police made it up. The rhetoric is trying to avoid the truth that the U.N. formally found that the whole thing is illegal, never even mentioning that Ecuador made a formal assessment through its formal processes and found that yes, I am subject to persecution by the United States.",1
127,Telescope That โ€Ate Astronomyโ€ Is on Track to Surpass Hubble - The New York Times,Dennis Overbye,"GREENBELT, Md.  โ€”   The next great space telescope spread its golden wings this month. Like the petals of a   sunflower seeking the light, the 18 hexagonal mirrors that make up the heart of NASAโ€s James Webb Space Telescope were faced toward a   balcony overlooking a cavernous clean room at the Goddard Space Flight Center here. Inside the room, reporters and a gaggle of space agency officials, including the ebullient administrator Charles Bolden, were getting their pictures taken in front of the giant mirror. Now, after 20 years with a budget of $8. 7 billion, the Webb telescope is on track and on budget to be launched in October 2018 and sent a million miles from Earth, NASA says. The telescope, named after NASA Administrator James Webb, who led the space agency in the 1960s, is the   successor of the Hubble Space Telescope. Seven times larger than the Hubble in   ability, the Webb was designed to see farther out in space and deeper into the past of the universe. It may solve mysteries about how and when the first stars and galaxies emerged some 13 billion years ago in the smoky aftermath of the Big Bang. Equipped with the sort of infrared goggles that give troops and police officers night vision, the Webb would peer into the dust clouds and gas storms of the Milky Way in which stars and planets are presently being birthed. It would be able to study planets around other stars. That has been NASAโ€s dream since 1996 when the idea for the telescope was conceived with a projected price tag then of $500 million But as recently as six years ago, the James Webb Space Telescope was, in the words of Nature magazine, โ€the telescope that ate astronomy,โ€ mismanaged, over budget and behind schedule so that it had crushed everything else out of NASAโ€s science budget. A House subcommittee once voted to cancel it. Instead, the program was rebooted with a strict spending cap. The scientific capabilities of the telescope emerged unscathed from that period, astronomers on the project say. The major change, said Jonathan P. Gardner, the deputy senior project scientist, was to simplify the testing of the telescope. Most of the pain was dealt to other NASA projects like a proposed space telescope to study dark energy, which the National Academy of Sciences had hoped to put on a fast track to be launched this decade. Itโ€s now delayed until 2025 or so. Typically for NASA, the Webb telescope was a technologically ambitious project, requiring 10 new technologies to make it work. Bill Ochs, a veteran Goddard engineer who became project manager in 2010 during what he calls the โ€replan,โ€ said the key to its success so far, was having enough money in the budget to provide a cushion for nasty surprises. The telescope smiling up at us like a giant Tiffany shaving mirror is 6. 5 meters in diameter, or just over 21 feet, compared with 2. 4 meters for the Hubble. The aim is to explore a realm of cosmic history about 150 million to one billion years after time began  โ€”   known as the reionization epoch, when bright and violent new stars and the searing radiation from quasars were burning away a gloomy fog of hydrogen gas that prevailed at the end of the Big Bang. In fact, astronomers donโ€t know how the spectacle that greets our eyes every night when the sun goes down or the lights go out wrenched itself into luminous existence. They theorize that an initial generation of stars made purely of hydrogen and helium  โ€”   the elements created during the Big Bang  โ€”   burned ferociously and exploded apocalyptically,   the seeding of the cosmos with progressively more diverse materials. But nobody has ever seen any   Population 3 stars, as those first stars are known. They donโ€t exist in the modern universe. Astronomers have to hunt them in the dim past. That ambition requires the Webb to be tuned to a different kind of light than our eyes or the Hubble can see. Because the expansion of the cosmos is rushing those earliest stars and galaxies away from us so fast, their light is โ€ โ€ to longer wavelengths the way the siren from an ambulance shifts to a lower register as it passes by. So blue light from an infant galaxy bursting with bright spanking new stars way back then has been stretched to invisible infrared wavelengths, or heat radiation, by the time it reaches us 13 billion years later. As a result, the Webb telescope will produce cosmic postcards in colors no eye has ever seen. It also turns out that infrared emanations are the best way to study exoplanets, the worlds beyond our own solar system that have been discovered in the thousands since the Webb telescope was first conceived. In order to see those infrared colors, however, the telescope has to be very cold  โ€”   less than 45 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero  โ€”   so that its own heat does not swamp the heat from outer space. Once in space, the telescope will unfold a giant umbrella the size of a tennis court to keep the sun off it. The telescope, marooned in permanent shade a million miles beyond the moon, will experience an infinite cold soak. The sunshield consists of five thin,   layers of a material called Kapton. Way too big to fit into a rocket, the shield, as well as the telescope mirror, will have be launched folded up. It will then be unfolded in space in a series of some 180 maneuvers that look in computer animations like a cross between a parachute opening and a swimming pool cover going into place. Or at least that is the $8 billion plan. Engineers have done it on the ground, and it worked. The same people who refolded the shield after each test will fold it again, in a process Mr. Ochs compares to packing up your parachute before a jump. The test will come in space, where no one will be able to help if things go wrong. That whole process will amount to what Mr. Ochs called โ€six months of high anxiety. โ€ โ€For the most part, it all has to work,โ€ Mr. Ochs said. The last time NASA did something this big astronomically, in 1990, things didnโ€t quite work. Once in orbit, the Hubble couldnโ€t be focused it had a misshapen mirror that had never been properly tested. Astronauts eventually fitted it with corrective lenses, and it went on to become the crown jewel of astronomy. Making sure that doesnโ€t happen this time is the agenda for the next two years. โ€Our telescope is finished,โ€ John C. Mather, the senior project scientist, said. โ€Now we are about to prove it works. โ€ In the coming weeks, the mirror and the box of scientific instruments on its back will be put on a rig and shaken to simulate the vibrations of a launch, and then sealed in an acoustic chamber and bombarded with the noise of a launch. If the parts survive unscathed, the telescope assembly will be shipped to a giant vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. There it will be chilled to the   temperatures at which it will have to work, and engineers will actually focus the telescope, twiddling the controls for seven actuators on each of the 18 mirror segments. No Hubble surprises here. Then the telescope will go to Los Angeles to be mounted on its gigantic sunshield. That whole contraption, now too big for even the giant   military transport plane, will travel by ship through the Panama Canal to French Guiana. It will be launched on an Ariane 5 rocket supplied by the European Space Agency as part of Europeโ€s contribution to the observatory, and go into orbit around the sun at a point called L2 about a million miles from Earth. Canada, NASAโ€s other partner, supplied some of the instruments. Then come the six months of anxiety. Sometime in the spring of 2019, if all goes well, the telescope will record its first real image  โ€”   of what, the assembled astronomers were not ready to guess. In a bonus undreamed of when the Webb telescope was first conceived, it looks as if the Hubble will still be going strong when the Webb is launched. They will share the sky and the potential for joint observing projects. A million miles apart, they can view objects in the solar system from different angles, providing a kind of stereoscopic perspective. Besides the expected baby galaxies and the exoplanets, there are, as astronomers like to remind us, always new surprises (like colliding black holes when the LIGO observatory was turned on last year) when humanity devises a new way to look at the sky. Asked what the telescopeโ€s greatest discovery would be, Dr. Mather said, โ€If I knew, I would tell you. โ€ Nor would the project members talk about contingency plans to rescue the telescope if anything goes wrong a million miles from Earth. There are no plans to fix it or bring it back. They know how to attach a probe or robot to the telescope, Dr. Mather said, but โ€we are planning to not need it, thank you. โ€",0
128,Closed Afghan-Pakistani Border Is Becoming โ€Humanitarian Crisisโ€ - The New York Times,Mujib Mashal,"KABUL, Afghanistan  โ€”   Pakistan has kept its border crossings with Afghanistan sealed for more than two weeks, with thousands of Afghan visitors stranded in Pakistan and traders unable to move their vegetables and fruit across. After a suicide bombing at a shrine in Pakistanโ€s Sindh Province on Feb. 16, which killed more than 80 people, the Pakistani military shut its borders with Afghanistan, saying the terrorists behind the attack had sanctuaries in the country. It also carried out shelling into Afghanistan. Omar Zakhilwal, Afghanistanโ€s ambassador to Pakistan, said Sunday that if the border did not open soon, his government would be forced to airlift its stranded citizens, which could be a new low in the relationship between the neighboring countries. Their   border has long been a contentious issue. Ever since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001, Afghan and Western officials have said that the Afghan insurgencyโ€s leadership maintains havens in Pakistan, particularly in the city of Quetta. The free movement across the border has helped the militants avoid defeat in a   war led by the United States. In recent years, the Pakistani authorities have said the leaders of the militant groups waging deadly attacks inside their territory are based across the border in Afghanistan. Mr. Zakhilwal, the Afghan ambassador, said some leaders of these attacks on Pakistan might be in Afghanistan, but they mostly operate in areas controlled by the Afghan Taliban. He said his government, along with the United   coalition, had targeted Pakistani militants in Afghanistan, including the mastermind of a massacre of children in a Pakistani school in 2014. Imran Khan, an opposition leader in Pakistan, said on Saturday that the border closing was โ€building into a humanitarian crisis. โ€ He called on both governments to resolve the crisis so โ€those with valid travel documents and perishable goodsโ€ could cross. Afghan officials have protested the closing, saying that Pakistan has used the shrine attack as a pretext to pressure Afghanistan economically. Mr. Zakhilwal said Pakistan was making a โ€flawed connectionโ€ between the shrine attack and the border. The assault on the shrine was claimed by the Islamic State, whose regional chapter is largely made up of fighters from the Pakistani tribal areas. Afghan forces in the east have been fighting the group, which has also carried out deadly attacks inside Afghanistan, for nearly two years. If the reason for blocking the border is to stop the flow of terrorists into Pakistan, Mr. Zakhilwal said it made no sense to prevent the return of the thousands of Afghans stranded in Pakistan, many of whom had traveled there for medical reasons. The long border is porous, and Pakistan is focusing only on the formal crossing points. In Kabul, the toll of the border closing is evident in the markets, with the price of fruit and vegetables imported from Pakistan more than doubling. But the price for many other goods has been unaffected, because Afghanistan also imports from Iran and some Central Asian nations. Nasir Ahmad, a shopkeeper at Kabulโ€s vegetable market, said a crate of oranges that used to be $4 had increased to $12. A box of bananas, which used to be about $12, is now about $25. Khanjan Alokozay, the deputy chairman of the Afghan chamber of commerce, estimated that traders from both countries were losing about $4 million a day because of the border closing. Pakistani traders are bearing about 80 percent of those losses, because during the winter Pakistani exports of fruit and vegetables to Afghanistan increase. Mr. Alokozay said thousands of trucks on both sides of the border had remained stranded, and Afghan businessmen have been urged to find other routes to transport their goods. Since the closing, Afghan border officials said that Pakistan was allowing only funeral processions to cross over. Some of those stranded have resorted to paying smugglers and taking dangerous mountain passes to return home. โ€Pakistanis are not allowing anyone to cross the border, and they order their forces to shoot anyone who is trying to cross the border,โ€ said Haji Iqbal, an Afghan who recently returned from Pakistan with the help of friends who asked Pakistani forces to let him cross through a mountain pass. โ€I walked for two hours. โ€",0

132,I Ignored Trump News for a Week. Hereโ€s What I Learned. - The New York Times,Farhad Manjoo,"I spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didnโ€t read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president. What I missed, by many accounts, was one of the strangest and most unpredictable weeks of news in modern political history. Among other things, there was the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and an โ€Oprah Winfrey Showโ€ tape that led to the downfall of the nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew F. Puzder. It wasnโ€t my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours) but shifted most of my energy to looking for   zones. My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no   part of the press. But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else. The new president doesnโ€t simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow. Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be   and averted my eyes as I scrolled for   news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for   sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.) Even when I found   news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a    cake without getting any fruit or nuts. It wasnโ€t just news. Mr. Trumpโ€s presence looms over much more. There he is off in the wings of โ€The Bachelorโ€ and even โ€The Big Bang Theory,โ€ whose creator, Chuck Lorre, has taken to inserting   messages in the closing credits. Want to watch an awards show? Say the Grammys or the Golden Globes? Trump Trump Trump. How about sports? Yeah, no. The presidentโ€s policies are an animating force in the N. B. A. He was the subtext of the Super Bowl: both the game and the commercials, and maybe even the halftime show. Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon. com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wifeโ€s Valentineโ€s Day present. (I bought her jewelry.) All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. Itโ€s possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past  โ€”   say, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler  โ€”   dominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now. Iโ€m hedging because there isnโ€t data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence. Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures โ€earned media,โ€ which is all coverage that isnโ€t paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising. In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuantโ€s records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the companyโ€s chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obamaโ€s monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July. Itโ€s not just that Mr. Trumpโ€s coverage beats anyone elseโ€s. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1, 000 of the worldโ€s best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million) Kim Kardashian ($36 million) and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million) all the way down to the 1, 000th   celebrity in mediaQuantโ€s database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1, 001). The coverage those 1, 000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1, 000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatoriโ€s preliminary figures. How do we know Mr. Trump is more talked about than anyone else in the past? There are now more people on the planet who are more connected than ever before. Facebook estimates that about 3. 2 billion people have internet connections. On average, the people of Earth spend about eight hours a day consuming media, according to the marketing research firm Zenith. So almost by definition, anyone who dominates todayโ€s media is going to be read about, talked about and watched by more people than ever before. โ€From a media perspective, itโ€s pretty clear,โ€ Mr. Senatori said. โ€The sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, heโ€s off the charts. โ€ Mr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet thereโ€s an argument that our   modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond whatโ€s called for. On most days, Mr. Trump is 90 percent of the news on my Twitter and Facebook feeds, and probably yours, too. But heโ€s not 90 percent of whatโ€s important in the world. During my break from Trump news, I found rich coverage veins that arenโ€t getting social play. ISIS is retreating across Iraq and Syria. Brazil seems on the verge of chaos. A large ice shelf in Antarctica is close to full break. Scientists may have discovered a new continent submerged under the ocean near Australia. Thereโ€s a reason you arenโ€t seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike   media, todayโ€s media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable. Scholars have long predicted that social media might alter how we choose cultural products. In 2006, Duncan Watts, a researcher at Microsoft who studies social networks, and two colleagues published a study arguing that social signals create a kind of โ€inequalityโ€ in how we choose media. The researchers demonstrated this with an online market for music downloads. Half of the people who arrived at Mr. Wattsโ€s   site were shown just the titles and band name of each song. The other half were also shown a social signal  โ€”   how many times each song had been downloaded by other users. Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular. I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. Itโ€s not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals  โ€”   likes, retweets and more  โ€”   are amplifying it. Every new story prompts outrage, which puts the stories higher in your feed, which prompts more coverage, which encourages more talk, and on and on. We saw this effect before Mr. Trump came on the scene  โ€”   itโ€s why you know about Cecil the lion and Harambe the gorilla  โ€”   but he has accelerated the trend. He is the Harambe of politics, the undisputed king of all media. Itโ€s only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone  โ€”   reporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news  โ€”   has been amped up to 11. For now, this might be all right. Itโ€s important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening. But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And itโ€s probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long. In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Todayโ€s newspapers are also full of   articles, but many of us arenโ€t reading newspapers anymore. Weโ€re reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else. Thereโ€s no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, heโ€s not everything  โ€”   and itโ€d be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.",0
133,Donald Trump Unveils Plan for Families in Bid for Womenโ€s Votes - The New York Times,Nick Corasaniti and Maggie Haberman,"ASTON, Pa.  โ€”   Donald J. Trump unveiled a menu of proposals on Tuesday to help working parents, calling for six weeks of mandatory paid maternity leave and expanded tax credits for child care. The proposals, which Mr. Trump outlined in the politically critical Philadelphia suburbs along with his daughter Ivanka, represent a new attempt to court female voters who polls show have been alienated by his bombast and history of provocative remarks about women. โ€Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the   factory worker, the family worried about security or the mom struggling to afford child care,โ€ Mr. Trump said at a rally here. Mr. Trumpโ€s decision to put forward such a plan represents a different approach from the one taken by previous Republican presidential nominees. But in selling his case, Mr. Trump stretched the truth, saying that his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has no such plan of her own and โ€never will. โ€ Mrs. Clinton issued her plan more than a year ago, and it guarantees up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for a newborn or a sick relative, financed by an increase in taxes on the wealthiest Americans. On Twitter, her campaign posted a link to her plan after Mr. Trumpโ€s remark. Mr. Trump and his daughter spoke about the issue at the Republican National Convention in July, but the candidate had not mentioned it publicly until Tuesday. Mr. Trump faces a potentially   gender gap with women, but pushing the proposal so close to the election risks looking slapdash on a serious topic. The campaign staved off potential complaints from social conservatives who have historically frowned on giving incentives to mothers to work outside the home, by vowing to make those caretaker roles  . At the speech, Mr. Trump was joined by some female members of Congress. Noting one applauding in the audience as he spoke, Mr. Trump pointed to the crowd and said, โ€Makes your life a lot easier, right?โ€ Mr. Trump first proposed the child care initiative weeks ago, but he broadened it to help working parents after facing criticism that his initial proposal would primarily help high earners rather than women and families on the lower end of the economic spectrum. โ€Child care is such a big problem,โ€ he said Tuesday. โ€And weโ€re going to solve that problem. โ€ Ms. Trump, who stood next to her father as he spoke in Pennsylvania, said she would make the planโ€s passage a priority if her father won. Affordable child care โ€should not be the luxury of a fortunate few,โ€ she said. The new recommendations contained a number of uncertainties, most notably how Mr. Trump would pay for them, and they still favor people with higher incomes. The candidateโ€s aides said his goals would be achieved through a change in the tax code to help pay for child care, to be detailed in another speech, probably this week. The main thrust of Mr. Trumpโ€s plan involves a reordering of the tax code so working parents can take an income tax deduction for care of up to four children and   dependents. The deduction is available for individuals earning up to $250, 000, or $500, 000 for a married couple filing jointly. There would also be child care spending rebates as high as $1, 200 a year for families on the lower end of the income scale. That is an amount that some critics called inadequate given that the cost of child care in some states is $10, 000 to $20, 000 a year. Another proposal aimed at   parents is a dependent care savings account, a version of a flexible spending account usually offered by employers. Such accounts would be universal and used for   or traditional child care, with a government match of $500 a year  โ€”   a minuscule amount given the cost of such care, and given the difficulty that   families have putting away money in such accounts. Among the open questions are whether the deductions that working parents could claim would replace the existing   tax credit, whether there would be an age cap for the children involved, and what the actual scale of benefit would be for people of various incomes. The signature element of the plan, six weeks of paid maternity leave for new mothers whose employers do not currently provide coverage, would be financed by eliminating fraud in unemployment insurance. Mr. Trumpโ€s aides trumpeted the proposal as unprecedented for a G. O. P. presidential nominee many Republicans oppose requiring paid maternity leave as an onerous new regulation on businesses. Earlier Tuesday, at a campaign rally in Clive, Iowa, the candidate singled out Ivanka Trump, a mother of three who has developed her own licensing and branding company, as the driving force behind the plan. Some social conservatives said they were pleasantly surprised by Mr. Trumpโ€s proposed tax benefit for    mothers. โ€I was quite pleased with it,โ€ said Tony Perkins of the conservative Family Research Council. He called it โ€innovativeโ€ in acknowledging โ€the contribution that    parents make. โ€ But the plan was met with criticism from the Clinton campaign and skepticism from some child care advocacy groups, which warned that the people most in need of relief would not get it. โ€After spending his entire career  โ€”   and this entire campaign  โ€”   demeaning women and dismissing the need to support working families,โ€ Maya Harris, Mrs. Clintonโ€s senior policy adviser, said in a statement, โ€Donald Trump released a regressive and insufficient โ€maternity leaveโ€ policy that is out of touch,   and ignores the way Americans live and work today. โ€ Vivien Labaton, a director of the nonpartisan group Make It Work Action, called Mr. Trumpโ€s plan โ€woefully inadequate. โ€ She said the   tax credit component meant that families in need would have to wait to receive relief just once a year, and called the $1, 200 rebate a โ€drop in the bucketโ€ for   families who were facing child care costs of more than $10, 000 a year. Paid leave has increasing political resonance. One of the major reasons the share of women working in the United States has fallen behind other developed countries is the lack of paid family leave, according to research by Cornell University economists. Mr. Trumpโ€s embrace of paid leave would apply only to mothers, as opposed to Mrs. Clintonโ€s plan, which would cover both parents. Some economists say that when leave is offered only to women, it can backfire by lowering womenโ€s chances of being hired and promoted and getting raises. Ms. Labaton expressed skepticism about the proposal โ€coming less than 60 days before Election Day,โ€ deriding it as โ€a naked attempt to court women voters while not actually offering up much by way of genuine support. โ€",0

Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani says the European Union can play a significant role in the settlement of the Syrian crisis and the campaign against terrorism. 
Larijani made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Finnish President Sauli Niinistรถ in Tehran on Wednesday. 
He said that Iran supports political solutions to crises in the Middle East, including the conflict in Syria, while some extra-regional players as well as regional sponsors of terrorist groups sabotaged diplomatic solutions through adopting wrong approaches. 
The top Iranian parliamentarian also warned against the spillover of terrorism to other regions across the world. 
โ€Unfortunately, military intervention by outsiders in regional issues and adopting a military approach and double standards on terrorismโ€ have led to a rise in the number of terrorist groups and contributed to their activities, Larijani said. 
He also blamed the โ€extremist and deviatedโ€ ideology of Wahhabism for the spread of terrorism in the region, stressing that neither Sunnis nor Shias support terrorist or extremist acts. 
Elsewhere in his remarks, Larijani welcomed the expansion of ties between Tehran and Helsinki. 
The Finnish official, for his part, called for the further promotion of ties between his country and Iran. 
He also expressed regret about terrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria and the lack of a political will to end the conflicts. 
โ€Terrorists pose threat to their own countriesโ€ 
Also on Wednesday, the Finnish president met with Chairman of Iran's Expediency Council Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to discuss bilateral ties and regional developments.

In the meeting, Rafsanjani warned about possible threats posed by foreign recruits when they return to their own countries and the subsequent rise of terrorism across the world, and called on the international community to take measures to address the issue. 
The senior Iranian official also raised the alarm over the issue of โ€state terrorismโ€ pursued by the Zionists. 
Earlier in the day, Finlandโ€s president also met and held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on the developments in the Middle East and the promotion of bilateral ties in different sectors, including economic and banking cooperation.

135,FBI Director Comeyโ€s โ€Leakedโ€ Memo Explains Why Heโ€s Reopening the Clinton Email Case,nan,"
21st Century Wire saysโ€ฆ 
21WIRE reported on Friday about the FBIโ€s surprising announcement that it would be reopening the Clinton email case due to new evidence of โ€classified informationโ€ found on sex cheat Anthony Weinerโ€s (newly estranged husband of Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin) computer which was subject to a seperate investigation. Will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the Nov 8th election, or is this just clever Democrat party smoke and mirrors? It seems that Washingtonโ€s political tricksters have already sprung into actionโ€ฆ 
After Comeyโ€s shock announcement, a โ€leakedโ€ memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to Fox News , in which Comey and the FBI seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. 
ELITE CIRCLES: FBI head James Comey and friend Hillary Clinton. 
Certainly, a desperate Democratic Party, and an even more desperate Obama White House (over the last 3 weeks, Obama and his wife Michelle have been out campaigning more that Hillary Clinton herself), could be pressuring or nudging the FBI on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against Donald Trump. Aside from the obvious potential of another Clinton scandal, yesterdayโ€s FBI move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios: Protect the President, who is already deeply tied to the Clinton email cover-up Democratic Party Machine has created a distraction to cover-up latest Wikileaks dump. FBI are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring Hillary Clintons. Create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious Trump scandal next week. 
NOTE: Despite calls from the Clinton camp for FBI to disclose what they have (which they cannot by law anyway, youโ€d think Hillary would have already known that), it is highly unlikely that the FBI will release any real specifics before the election โ€“ if they have anything at all. Itโ€s just too early to tell. 
SEE ALSO: FBI James Comey was board member of HSBC โ€“ Clinton Foundation & Drug Cartel โ€bank of choiceโ€ 
The FBI director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the Justice Department seek an indictment against Clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation โ€“ allowing Clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election โ€“ despite the fact that Comey stated to a Congressional investigative committee that Clinton was โ€extremely careless,โ€ and that Clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the US Secretary of State. 
Zero Hedge adds: 
โ€Now, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. Needless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcoratsโ€ trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.โ€ 
Here is โ€leakedโ€ (aka โ€just covering my ass) memo from FBI director James Comey: 
Watch this space. Here is a highlight reel of Hillary Clinton lying on at least 5 occasions when asked direct questions about her illegal private email server:

At the Tribunal, 750 people participated in The Hague representing 30 nationalities from all over the world, thousands of people followed online on the livestream and social media, and the Tribunal received a lot of press attention.
Both victims and experts thanked us for giving them a voice on this important international platform โ€” and a very well documented voice in this new process to hold corporations accountable for their acts.
The chairwoman of the Tribunal, Judge Tulkens, expressed the importance of the Tribunal in an interview with the French newspaper, Le Monde:
The questions of the access to water and to healthy food are old. Those are not new issues coming out of the mind of angry activists. Those issues, just like the right to a healthy environment are likely to become more important with climate change. It is our duty to set legal tools to face those issues. The Monsanto Tribunal is a step and a tool within this dynamic.โ€ 
The Tribunal received quite a lot of media coverage. From French and German TV news programs to many newspapers and radio programs in various countries. See the links on our social media platforms (and later on the website).
Did Monsanto attend the Tribunal? Monsanto was invited to the Tribunal, but decided not to appear for their defense. We did get their attention though. They issued a statement in 5 languages saying that we are โ€pushingโ€ the wrong issues, since the real discussion is about feeding the world. Monsanto fails to see feeding the world in a safe way was exactly the topic of the Tribunal and of the discussion farmers, consumer movements, and their associated networks had in the parallel Peopleโ€s Assembly.
Many eminent speakers stressed that Monsanto and agribusiness giants like them do not feed the world. Rather, they are involved in producing commodities, feed for animals, fuel for cars, and sugar for the food industry at a very high cost for human health and environment. This is production that feeds profit, not people. Itโ€s the small- and medium-scale farmers that are actually feeding the world.
What is the purpose of the Monsanto Tribunal and the Peopleโ€s Assembly? This Tribunal and Peopleโ€s Assembly are about showing the tremendous costs of industrial farming for humans, for health, and for nature . They are also about standing up to Monsanto and their likes, and stopping them from poisoning our world and controlling our food supply. One way to do this is by showing the true cost of the current global food system, and the very real alternatives that exist.
Nnimmo Bassey at the opening said :
Being an ambassador to this Tribunal is like being an ambassador to mother Earth. If mother Earth could speak, Monsanto ought to be in jail long before now. Food is a celebration, it is culture, it is life. This is a struggle not against one multinational corporation, it is a struggle for life, it is a struggle for liberty. A struggle to stop big companies from colonizing our food systems, colonizing our agriculture, holding mother Earth as a slave for their profits.โ€ 
If you want, you can follow the Monsanto Tribunal on Facebook , where many pictures and videos have already been posted. You can also see them if you have no Facebook yourself. In the coming weeks, we will continue to release short interviews of the witnesses, experts and lawyers, as well as the speakers in the Peopleโ€s Assembly. We will also add all of this to our website , including all the hearings of the Tribunal and the written testimonies in different languages. Please be patient, we will keep you informed!
What happens now that the Tribunal is over? The judges are now thoroughly reviewing the evidence from legal briefs and witness testimonies to answer the six questions posed in the Tribunalโ€s terms of reference. They will then present a legal advisory opinion, hopefully soon but if necessary next spring: we will supply logistic support, but the timing is up to them.
As Judge Tulkens said:
We will try to deliver the legal opinion before December 10th, the International Day of human Rights. It will be addressed to Monsanto and to the United Nations. From this legal opinion, other jurisdictions can be involved and more judges will step in. We, as the judges [at the Monsanto Tribunal]have seen, heard, noted and deliberated. Chances are that the international law will take into consideration new issues such as the ones related to ecocide.โ€ 
What you can do to help We would like to thank you and all the volunteers for your amazing support. This would not have been possible without you. Stay tuned, follow us on social media, show your support and share messages wherever and whenever you can. Ask friends to sign their support . Together we will put an end to the era of poisoning and exploiting the world and move onward to a system where we work with nature instead of waging a war against it.

Here's the thing:Today, October 27, 2016, I, like many of you, watched live feeds of the events going down at Standing Rock.I am at a loss to define my feelings. Anger, outrage, pity, fear 
...One phrase kept going through my mind, like a mantra- This is not my America. This is not my America. This is not my America. protests at DAPL License DMCA 
And then in counter-point was the thought- But it is. But it is. But it is.Over one hundred heavily armed cops in riot gear, supported by military assault vehicles and helicopters forced peaceful, prayerful water protectors from their own land, ceded to them in the Treaty of 1851. The police are nothing more than a mercenary army protecting the interests of the owners of the DAPL. There was the wail of sound cannons aimed at the protectors, there was tear gas. There were rubber bullets being fired into the crowd.And in my mind- This is not my America (But it is) This is not my America (But it is) This is not my America (But it is) This is about water. There's no political ideology here. We cannot live without water. Decisions are being made that effect the future, and the lives of our children and our grandchildren.This effects all of us. It's not just happening ""out there"" in the Dakotas or in Iowa or in Texas or in New Mexico. It's everywhere. For god sake, there are already over 2.5 million miles pipeline already installed in the continental United States. Just the other day, mere miles from where I live a Sunoco pipeline leaked over 55,000 gallons of gasoline into the Susquehanna River, endangering the water for over 6 million people down river. Where I live, in northeastern Pennsylvania, there are fracking wells all over the place. And an average of 2.8 million of gallons of clean water were filled with known poisons and toxins and pumped under pressure into the aquifer beneath my feet. There are places within miles of where I live that people can set fire to their water.It's too late for anyone to avoid the destruction, here where I live. We have to deal with the aftermath. The after the fact poisoning of our water and the inevitable leaks and the illnesses and the pockets of strange cancers. This is a shameful day, for all of us. I am sick, in heart, mind and spirit, but I have hope.The battle hasn't even started. Now is when decisions must be made. Hard decisions that will impact on our own sense of comfort and will demand that we risk that comfort, or lose the future. To do nothing is to accept that our children,and our grandchildren will have no clean water to drink, no clean air to breathe, no clean land to live on.This is not overstating the things. It is not alarmist. It is the simplest of truths. - Advertisement -",1
139,Itโ€s Official: Simone Biles Is the Worldโ€s Best Gymnast - The New York Times,"Victor Mather, Doug Mills and Chang W. Lee","RIO DE JANEIRO  โ€”   Simone Biles, already considered the worldโ€s greatest female gymnast before even competing in the Olympics, emphatically confirmed her standing on Thursday by winning the womenโ€s individual   gold medal at the Rio Games. Wearing a    leotard, Biles, 19, joined Mary Lou Retton, Carly Patterson, Nastia Liukin and Gabby Douglas as American   winners. The American Aly Raisman, 22, won the silver, and Aliya Mustafina, 21, of Russia won bronze. Victory in this event brings lucrative endorsements and widespread adoration, a popularity bonanza fueled by a   showcase of athletic artistry. At 4 feet 9 inches, with size 5 feet, Biles is someone that young viewers can relate to. Then she performs, and her abilities are unimaginable. Her ascent has been sudden to those who follow gymnastics only every four years. At the last Summer Games, in London in 2012, Douglas was the  . Biles arrived here from Texas and gave the Rio Games a performance for the ages. Whether you know an Amanar from an aardvark, you watch her not because the result is in doubt but rather to witness something without equal. The first rotation on Thursday for the top gymnasts was the vault, and both Biles and Raisman broke out their Amanars. In that challenging vault, the gymnast performs a   onto the board and then a back handspring onto the table. She then completes     twists before a blind landing. Biles, as usual, flew higher and farther than anyone else, though she took a big step on her landing. It was enough for the top score of the day. Raisman also pulled off her Amanar, and the two Americans were   after one rotation. But after the uneven bars, Biles was in an unfamiliar place: second place. A strong performance by Mustafina, the 2012 champion in the bars, and a pedestrian one by Biles put the Russian ahead by a small margin. Raisman slipped to fourth. The score for Biles was lower than she has been used to getting. The bars is her weakest event, but the disappointment would shake some competitors and cause them to lose focus. But Biles isnโ€t just any competitor. Sheโ€s a   world champion. Biles looked a little nervous on the balance beam, wobbling at one point. But she made a great landing. After Mustafina   her full turn, had a few balance checks and left out a front aerial. Biles was back in front, and Raisman moved into third. The competition culminated with the floor exercise. Bilesโ€s first pass is a   double layout, and she followed that with her โ€Biles,โ€ a double layout with a half twist, then a stag leap. Her third and fourth passes were just as phenomenal. Her coach Aimee Boorman cried as Biles came off the floor. Her score: 15. 933, the highest of the day on any apparatus. Raisman nailed her own difficult tumbling passes to grab the silver.",0

141,It Literally Hurts My Brain to Read the Economic Idiocy Emitted by Trumpkins | Libertarian,beforeitsnews.com,"(Before It's News)
(Don Boudreaux)
Tweet
Hereโ€s a letter to the Wall Street Journal :
Wilbur Rossโ€s and Peter Navarroโ€s defense of Donald Trumpโ€s economic policies is mostly a mash of bunkum (โ€ A Vote for Trump Is a Vote for Growth ,โ€ Oct. 26). Consider this claim: โ€Donald Trump will cut taxes, reduce regulation โ€ฆ and eliminate our trade deficit through muscular trade negotiations that increase exports, [and] reduce importsโ€ฆ.โ€
Cut taxes? Bunk. Trump famously promises to raise taxes on Americans who buy imports. Reduce regulation? Rubbish. Trump promises more government intrusions into Americansโ€ commerce with foreigners.
As for โ€eliminatingโ€ our trade deficit, Trump might indeed succeed on that front. But such โ€successโ€ would be regrettable, for it would be the inevitable outcome of the American economy being made an unattractive destination for investment. (Ross and Navarro seem to be unaware that to โ€eliminate our trade deficitโ€ โ€“ such as was done, for example, during the Great Depression โ€“ is to eliminate net contributions by foreigners to increasing the size of Americaโ€s capital stock.)
But Trumpโ€s most absurd promise is to enrich Americans by increasing exports and reducing imports. Imports are what we voluntarily buy and exports are the price we pay. Therefore, a policy meant to increase exports while decreasing imports is a policy meant to force Americans to pay more to foreigners and to receive less in return โ€“ a decidedly unartful deal the architect of which would deserved to be fired.
But the Trump campโ€s confusion runs even more deeply. Exporting for Americans is worthwhile only because it supplies us with the means to purchase imports, either currently or in the future. So a policy that aims both to increase exports and to decrease imports is akin to a policy that aims both to increase peopleโ€s spending power and to decrease it. Itโ€s a policy meant to give Americans greater means for acquiring imports as it simultaneously strips Americans of the freedom to use those means. Itโ€s the economic policy equivalent of an attempt to square a circle.

Secretary General Complains That The โ€Masses Have Rejected Globalismโ€ In Favor Of Nationalism Antonio Guterres, elected in October to take over as U.N. secretary general next year, told a conference in his native Lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in Europe this year. He said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as Syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas.   22, 2016 The incoming head of the United Nations warned on Tuesday that โ€losers of globalizationโ€ in rich countries have felt ignored by establishment politicians, prompting them to turn to nationalist agendas, as in the U.S. election and Brexit referendum. โ€Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.โ€ Zephaniah 3:8 (KJV) EDITORโ€S NOTE: The Bible clearly says that Godโ€s desire is to โ€gather all the nations of the world togetherโ€, in order to โ€pour His furyโ€ upon them. The United Nations, something unique in world history, has been created by the will of God, and things are going to end exactly how the Bible says they will end. All Muslims will be driven out of Israel as prophesied in Zechariah 14:21 (KJV), Israel will expand its borders to cover the size of the original land grant to Abraham , and Jesus will rule the world from Jerusalem . And that will be the โ€newโ€ world order. Antonio Guterres, elected in October to take over as U.N. secretary general next year , told a conference in his native Lisbon that this trend had undermined the willingness to receive refugees in Europe this year. He said the world must re-establish international protection for refugees coming from war zones such as Syria, but it would not be easy as developed countries were turning to nationalist agendas. Antonio Guterres formally elected as UN chief: Europe has struggled to handle a huge influx of refugees, many of whom displaced by the war in Syria. The United States has accepted only a very small number of refugees and may take in even fewer next year. โ€In 2016, we have witnessed a dramatic deterioration of that international protection regime (for refugees),โ€ Guterres said. โ€This example started in the developed world, it started essentially in Europe, it is spreading now like a virus into other parts of the world.โ€ Guterres, who was U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees until last year, linked the growing resistance to accepting refugees to wider concerns about globalism. โ€I donโ€t think we can look strictly at the refugee issue, I think the problem is a broader problem,โ€ he told the conference on Europeโ€s refugee crisis. There was a consensus in the mid-1990s that globalization would benefit all, he said. โ€But a lot of people were left behind โ€ฆ In the developed world, (there are) those who have been losers in globalization,โ€ he said. โ€The recent analysis of the rust belt in the United States, I think, is a clear demonstration of that, when we speak about the elections.โ€ Donald Trump won this monthโ€s election in the United States in part thanks to support from voters who have seen their jobs lost to countries with cheaper labor. โ€So globalization has not been as successful as we had hoped and lots of people became not only angry with it, but feeling that political establishments and international organizations are not paying attention, were not taking care (of them),โ€ he said. This led to what he called โ€a kind of evolutionโ€ in which anti-establishment parties now tended to win elections and referendums tended to attract majorities against whatever was put to a vote. source SHARE THIS ARTICLE  ",1
144,Trump Bollywood Ad Meant To Sway Indian American Voters Is An Hilarious Fail (VIDEO),T Steelman,"Google Pinterest Digg Linkedin Reddit Stumbleupon Print Delicious Pocket Tumblr 
Add another group to the list of people who wonโ€t be voting for Donald Trump. Oh, a few of them might but after they see this ad for Trump, Iโ€m betting the majority will laugh and vote for Hillary Clinton. 
Earlier in the month, Trump attended a Bollywood concert for charity. It was organized by the Republican Hindu Coalition, a group that was founded by a rich Indian-American named Shalli Kumar, who is looking to be the Hindu Sheldon Adelson. The Indian community is heavily Democratic so good luck with that. 
Trump came to the event, lit the Diya โ€” itโ€s doubtful that he had any idea what it was โ€” and then spoke. He pandered told the attendees that โ€the Indian and Hindu community will have a true friend in the White House,โ€ promising they will โ€defeat radical Islamic terrorism.โ€ 
This inspired Kumar to make an ad which will be playing 20 times a day on Indian-American channels. He refused to say how much it cost the campaign to buy that much time but we can guess that Mr. Kumar is helping foot the bill. He previously has given almost $1 million to a fundraising committee which benefited both Trump and the RNC. 
There is a lot to laugh about in the ad, bt Trumpโ€s inability to pronounce Hindi words takes teh cake. It is such an obvious bit of pandering, even for him. 
The ad starts with a wish for a Happy Diwali , a holiday I am certain Trump is ignorant of. The cut to Trumpโ€s orange face is a bit jarring after the pretty lights and flowers. 
Kumar wanted to draw a similarity between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The PMโ€s campaign had used a clever catchphrase which loosely translates to โ€This time a Modi government.โ€ Kumar wanted Trump to replace Modiโ€s name with his own. In Hindi, that is โ€Ab ki baar Trump sarkar.โ€ Donโ€t get ahead of me, now. 
In the ad, which uses footage of Trumps speech at the charity concert, a 2008 photo of the hotel which was attacked by Islamic militants in Mumbai gives way to a picture of PM Modi. Then back to Trump who tries to speak the short Hindi phrase. Itโ€s something one must see to believe. 
Make sure you arenโ€t drinking anything as you may endanger your computer. 
โ€Approved by Donald Trump?โ€ Well, I guess so. This ad is not just pandering, it is awful. I hope the Indian American community laugh this off and then go vote against this man who only shows interest in their culture when it might get him votes. 
Oh, and Happy Diwali! May the light burn away any bad times and welcome the good.

145,FBI Finds Previously Unseen Hillary Clinton Emails On Weinerโ€s Laptop,Zero Hedge,"
Crushing the hope-filled โ€itโ€s just a backup of what they have already seenโ€ narrative of a campaign clutching at straws to defend their candidate, and confirming Fox News Bret Baierโ€s earlier reporting , CBS News reports that the FBI has found new, non-duplicate emails related to Hilary Clintonโ€s tenure as Secretary of State on Anthony Weinerโ€s laptop .
Sources earlier described to Fox Newsโ€ Bret Baier as an โ€avalanche of evidenceโ€ฆโ€ 
And tonight we are getting further clarification, from US Officials, as to what that evidence consists of (via CBS News) 
These emails, CBS Newsโ€ Andres Triay reports, are not duplicates of emails found on Secretary Clintonโ€s private server. 
At this point, however, it remains to be seen whether these emails are significant to the FBIโ€s investigation into Clinton.
It is also not known how many relevant emails there are.
This is a major problem for the surrogates, lawyers, life-long friends, and defenders of the status quo as it destroys the narrative that has been painted suggesting these emails found on Weinerโ€s laptop are merely backups of what law enforcement officials have already seen (and found no intent in).
But what is most intriguing is the question of whether the missing 33,000 โ€personalโ€ emails โ€deletedโ€ by Bryan Pagliano in the full knowledge of Hillary Clinton (according to Wikileaks emails), are also on the estranged husband of Clinton right-hand-lady Huma Abedinโ€s laptop.
As Federal law enforcement officials concluded to CBS News tonight :
โ€These emails have never been seen beforeโ€ 
Foxโ€s Bret Baier summed up what happens nextโ€ฆ
โ€I pressed again and again on this very issueโ€ฆ The investigations will continue, there is a lot of evidence. 
And barring some obstruction in some way, they believe they will continue to likely an indictment .โ€

146,"2 Years After This American Journalist Was Killed, Her โ€Conspiracy Theoriesโ€ on Syria are Proven as Facts",Starkman,"Serena Shim is an American citizen of Lebanese descent who was born near Detroit. Shim worked for Iranian broadcaster Press TV as a foreign correspondent covering wars, legitimate protests and fake uprisings in multiple countries. 
Via AnonHQ 

She reported live from Syria, Iraq, Turkey, and Lebanon during the conflict since 2011, including in the critical region of Daraa during the beginning of protests, which are misrepresented by American media as the reasons for the fake civil war. Serena Shim was killed two years ago on October 19, 2014, in Turkey while reporting on the intense battle for the Syrian border city of Kobani which was the focus of international media attention. She was 29 when she died.
Scroll Down For Video Below! The city of Kobani, which has one of Turkeyโ€s major border crossings with Syria, because it was under threat of being completely captured by the Islamic State. The US was forced to respond because Islamic State grew out of control and threatened the border stability of Turkey, and it became the first major area bombed during the US campaign in Syria.
The US and Turkey were also arguing over Washingtonโ€s plan to arm Kurdish fighters on the Syrian side of the border and how to allow Kurds from Iraq to support the effort by crossing through Turkey. On the day she was killed, the US began operations to airdrop weapons to the Kurds. Less than two days later, Islamic State fighters released a video showing the capture of an American weapons cache airdropped near the city. The video received international media attention which led the Pentagon to admit the weapons mistakenly reached ISIL terrorists.
It is claimed she was killed in a car accident with a cement truck. However, physical details about the case raise questions about the official explanation by Turkish officials. There are also conflicting stories about the timeline after her death and before the family received her body, which indicate actions by the government of Turkey and possibly the United States.
Two days before her death, Serena Shim reported on live international television that Turkish intelligence services were planning to arrest her for questioning on the suspicion her being a spy. The day after her death, US officials denied releasing any information it had about whether the US government was aware of Turkeyโ€s plans. State Department officials told WTF News it would be December 2017 before a Freedom of Information Act request could be completed for information on what actions were taken by them to assist her as a US citizen.
Serena Shim conducted an undercover investigation in Turkey and Syria lasting multiple months during 2012 as she spoke fluent Arabic. Her report aired on Press TV beginning in December 2012. The issues listed below are topics she reported on first or experienced in person before they were reported by major media outlets. US officials continue to hide her death and not a single major media outlet in America reported on her death at the time despite the fact that she was popular in America and the Middle East.
1. HILLARY CLINTONโ€S EMAILS PROVE THE US STATE DEPT AND WHITE HOUSE KNEW SAUDI ARABIA AND QATAR ARE FUNDING ISLAMIC STATE 
Clinton admitted, in an email conversation from August 2014 obtained by Wikileaks, that US allies Saudi Arabia and Qatar were sending money and weapons to ISIL. August 2014 was the height of terror during Islamic Stateโ€s rise, leading to the growing international media outrage which forced President Obama to publicly announce the beginning of airstrikes against ISIL in Syria on September 23, 2014.
THE FREE THOUGHT PROJECT 
โ€While this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.โ€ 
โ€The Qataris and Saudis will be put in a position of balancing policy between their ongoing competition to dominate the Sunni world and the consequences of serious U.S. pressure.โ€ 
The business newspaper Financial Times reported that Prince Saud al-Faisal admitted Saudi Arabia created and funded Islamic State as a response to the US supporting Shia powers in Iraq. The FT also reported in 2013that Qatar had already spent $3 billion on funding the opposition.
Americaโ€s top military official General Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was asked โ€Do you know any major Arab ally that embraces ISIL?โ€ by Republican Senator Lindsay Graham. โ€I know major Arab allies who fund them,โ€ replied Dempsey.
2. THE UNITED STATES WANTED THE ISLAMIC STATE TO GROW, AS PROVED BY LEAKED INTELLIGENCE DOCUMENTS 
The rapid growth of the Islamic State was not an accident, and many observers of the conflict questioned the US commitment to fighting terrorism as they ignored the groupโ€s rise. Since the start of the armed conflict in 2011, United States officials including Hillary Clinton have publicly stated that their solution to stop the war is to replace Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other government leaders. The public policy of the United States has been to support what the US calls moderate opposition groups under the name Free Syrian Army (FSA) with the goal of having them weaken the government forces.
That strategy changed in mid-2012 as news reports confirmed these rebels were committing war crimes by killing civilians and executing soldiers. One of the largest factions Al Nusra was specifically identified as a terrorist group in December 2012. At the same time, the Islamic State (known as Al Qaeda in Iraq) was growing in Syria and had become a dominant force by 2013. The Islamic State grew in Syria for almost two years before the US announced it would take military action in September 2014. The intelligence report was dated August 2012 confirms the US government would have known about this threat for two years.
JUDICIAL WATCH โ€If the situation unravels, there is the possibility of establishing a declared or undeclared Salafist Principality in eastern Syria (Hasaka and Der Zor), and this is exactly what the supporting powers to the opposition want, in order to isolate the Syrian regime, which is considered the strategic depth of the Shia expansion (Iraq and Iran).โ€Syria has been fought over for two separate gas pipeline projects, a pipeline from Qatar rejected by Assad for one from Iran. The second pipeline is a Russian plan to connect with Turkey to deliver gas to Europe; the deal was finalized less than two weeks ago.

147,Report: Illegal Aliens Forego Food Stamps to Stay off Trumpโ€s Radar,AWR Hawkins,"Illegal aliens in San Francisco have reportedly begun abstaining from food stamps in the belief it will help them avoid being detecting by the Trump administration. [In fact, so many residents have turned against food stamps that โ€the city is concerned. โ€  According to the San Francisco Chronicle, local Human Services Agency director Trent Rhorer has noted that โ€households with one illegalโ€ are wondering how much information will reach administration officials if they use food stamps, also known as CalFresh. Eligible families also wonder โ€whether the administration will cut food stamp benefits to immigrants. โ€ Rhorer is upset by the tension. He said, โ€[Eligible families] are putting their household in further jeopardy of not being able to pay the rent, or not being able to pay utility bills because they have to buy food. These are benefits they are entitled to receive, and theyโ€re playing by the rules. They shouldnโ€t be penalized by this negative commentary coming out of the White House. โ€ In the last two months the number of households withdrawing from food stamps has been well above the norm. For example, the normal drop rate is less than 60 households a month, yet โ€150 households withdrew from the program in March and April alone. โ€ Families where children are legal residents but were born to parents who came here illegally are most prone to drop CalFresh at this time, the Chronicle reports. But the city has made clear that the only people who have to provide information are the family members who apply for benefits. That is reportedly intended to limit the amount of information shared with the federal government. Under the Obama administration, Breitbart News noted at the time, the U. S. Department of Agriculture paid to run  in Mexico promoting U. S. food stamps so that when illegal aliens came to the U. S. they would be able to access the benefit.

[Armon Hanatziv, also known as East Talpiot, is located in southeastern Jerusalem, part of the eastern sections of Jerusalem declared โ€occupied Palestinian territoryโ€ by a United Nations Security Council resolution last month.  The promenade, a popular tourist site enjoyed for its spectacular views of Israelโ€s capital, is located about half a mile from the plot of land upon which the U. S. has been building a consulate that could serve as a future embassy if the current embassy is moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

He noticed a group of people coming off a bus that stopped along the promenade. As far as we know, he sped up and hit them,โ€ said Jerusalem District Police spokeswoman Galit Ziv. Qanbar was shot by a civilian tour guide and by soldiers at the scene. He immediately died of his wounds, police here said. The IDF released the following video testimony from one of the soldiers who responded to the attack by shooting Qanbar:   IDF soldiers reportedly raided Qanbarโ€s home after the attack, Magen David Adom paramedics at the scene said that a number of soldiers were trapped underneath the truck after it stopped when Qanbar was killed. An initial inquiry is focusing on reports that soldiers hesitated to initially shoot as Qanbar was perpetuating the attack. A military trainer who shot and killed the terrorist speculated that the hesitation might have stemmed from the conviction in a military court last week of Elor Azaria, an inexperienced    army combat medic who shot and killed a Palestinian terrorist in March after the terrorist stabbed an Israeli soldier and was lying on the ground supposedly neutralized after being shot. Azaria had said that he heard someone shout that the terrorist might be wearing an explosive device and he claimed that he acted to protect nearby soldiers. That claim was rejected by the military court. The military trainer, who would only identify himself as Eitan, told Israelโ€s Army Radio of the reported hesitation to show Qanbar:   โ€ฆ    the soldiers who were on the scene were hesitant to shoot at the truck that slammed into the group of people. The fact that Elor Azaria was convicted of manslaughter for shooting a wounded terrorist was the reason for this hesitation, according to Eitan. โ€There was hesitation to open fire. I have no doubt that this was a significant factor, because all they tell them recently is to be careful. It could be that a few minutes less of hesitation and the situation would have been better,โ€ he added. No terrorist group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. Hamasโ€s   military wing, however, took to Facebook to praise the carnage as a โ€heroicโ€ operation.  Hamas spokesperson Hazaem Qassem wrote that โ€the continuous operations in the West Bank and Jerusalem prove that the Jerusalem Intifada is not an isolated event, but rather a decision by the Palestinian people to revolt until they attain their freedom and liberation from the Israeli occupation. โ€ Aaron Klein is Breitbartโ€s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

151,Students At Black College Just Got Beaten And Maced For Protesting KKKโ€s David Duke,Colin Taylor,"Comments 
Last night, Louisiana Senate candidates vying for disgraced Senator David Vitterโ€s empty seat took the stage at the historically black Dillard University. Among them was former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke, who is making yet another run for public office. The students at Dillard rightfully came out to protest โ€“ but were met with shocking violence from the police. 
Seventy or so students protested Dukeโ€s presence at their college. โ€Theyโ€re allowing a terrorist, a neo-Nazi Ku Klux Klan member to be secured in a building in which we paid thousands of dollars to attend annually,โ€ said political science major Brielle Kennedy , who was arrested moments later. 
Nobody was allowed in the building during the debate, but students tried to enter anyway to express their fury โ€“ and were met with pepper-spray and beatings from police, who arrested six students. โ€They sprayed us directly in the face with it. I was covered on my shirt, my arms, my face. Theyโ€re bodyslamming people, they pulled girlsโ€ hair. Theyโ€re just acting like heathensโ€ recounted student Hannah Galloway. 
The debate itself went off the rails almost immediately as David Duke began complaining about โ€Jews ,โ€ saying that โ€there is a problem in America with a very strong, powerful tribal group that dominates our media, dominates our international banking.โ€ He then went on to say that โ€[Hillary Clinton] should be getting the electric chair, being charged with treason.โ€ 
What did the police and state board of elections expect would happen when they held a debate at a historically black school in the deep South and invited a deplorable white supremacist and prominent Trump supporter to attend? 
The violence with which the police reacted evokes the violence that white police visited on black protesters during Jim Crow and the battle for African-American civil rights โ€“ and is a painful symbol of how little has changed in the past sixty years. The fact that David Duke had the support to qualify for the ballot is evidence enough.",1
152,"Despite Strict Gun Control, One โ€Child or Youthโ€ Shot Every Day in Ontario",AWR Hawkins,"Despite stringent gun controls that read like a Democrat   for U. S. gun policy, a new study shows the province of Ontario, Canada, witnesses one โ€child or youthโ€ shot every day. [The study was conducted by the Canadian Medical Association Journal.  According to The Star, the lead author of the study, Dr. Natasha Saunders, said, โ€A child or youth injured by a gun each day in this province is staggering. โ€ She believes this should serve as impetus for doctors to be more involved in the conversation about firearms in Ontario, including conversations between doctors and their patients. Saunders said, โ€Our findings indicate that this is a conversation we should be having with our patients and their families, particularly with these     populations. โ€ The study shows that   children and youth are prone to accidental shootings while immigrants of the same age are prone to being shot intentionally. It also shows that children and youth in rural areas were more prone to accidental shootings while those in urban environments were prone to assaults with firearms. The study offers this explanation: The observed variation in firearm injury by region of origin may have been related to higher participation in Canadian gangs by   Caribbean and African immigrants than by those from other regions, and it highlights the need to ensure a healthy transition to Canada by these particular   groups. It is interesting to note that Canada has all the gun controls Democrats in the U. S. push as a means of keeping citizens safe. They have criminal background checks, mental background checks, and licensing requirements for gun ownership that include domestic abuse checks. In fact, The University of Sydneyโ€s GunPolicy. org reveals that โ€licensing authorities are required to conduct interviews with, or to advise an applicantโ€s spouse, partner, or next of kin before issuing a gun licence. โ€ This is clearly a step intended to discover any problem that may have slipped through the cracks during the numerous other checks required for a gun license. But despite these controls โ€”  and so many more โ€”  one โ€child or youthโ€ is shot every day in Ontario. These same โ€restrictiveโ€ controls also proved impotent to stop a determined attacker who killed six and wounded eight in Quebec on January 29. Breitbart News reported: The Quebec attack was similar to those in other European countries with restrictive gun control laws. For example, twelve people were shot and killed on January 7, 2015, when terrorists opened fire on Charlie Hebdo headquarters in   Paris. Just months later, on November 13, 2015, more terrorists in Paris opened fire and killed 130 innocents.

153,The Rise of the Internet Fan Bully - The New York Times,Amanda Hess,"Normani Kordei, a member of the girl group on the rise Fifth Harmony, sat for a lighthearted Facebook Live interview earlier this month. Within a week, she had been chased off Twitter by a mob spewing racist insults. โ€Iโ€ve not just been cyber bullied, Iโ€ve been racially cyber bullied with tweets and pictures so horrific and racially charged that I canโ€t subject myself any longer to the hate,โ€ she wrote. Her account has been silent since. Online harassment has become a depressingly common workplace hazard for people of color in the public eye. Last month, the โ€Ghostbustersโ€ star Leslie Jones temporarily quit Twitter after weathering a deluge of racist abuse. And last year, the Brazilian actress Taรญs Araรบjo reported a series of harassers to the police after they had inundated her Facebook page with similar comments. But the racist taunts hurled at Ms. Kordei didnโ€t originate from some white supremacist message board, or even from a crew of Fifth Harmony haters. It came from within the Fifth Harmony fandom itself. The incident illuminates some strange similarities between the bands of internet trolls stalking the web and the legions of online fans seeking to stir up some drama. They both know that the most hurtful weaponry to wield against black women include images of apes, threats of lynching and a    . Fifth Harmony is a Simon   girl group that snagged its first Top 10 hit this year with the saucy single โ€Work From Home. โ€ Its brand would best be described as โ€gyrating girl power. โ€ But when Ms. Kordei sat down with the digital lifestyle magazine Galore for the Facebook Live interview on the subject of female friendship, one question  โ€”   โ€Describe each girl in one wordโ€  โ€”   ripped a fault line through the groupโ€s young, female fan base. Of her bandmate Ally Brooke, Ms. Kordei said: โ€Sunshine, because she is literally the light of the group. โ€ Of Lauren Jauregui: โ€My therapist, I can go to her about absolutely anything, and I feel like I can trust that she wonโ€t judge anything that I say. โ€ And Dinah Jane: โ€Sheโ€s like the   queen, she just has a good time anywhere she is. โ€ When she reached Fifth Harmonyโ€s final member, Camila Cabello, she paused. โ€She is   โ€ฆ     letโ€s see. Camila. Very quirky. Yeah, very quirky. Um, cute. Quirky. โ€ Thatโ€s it. But that was enough to enrage some fans of Ms. Cabello, the    who has been positioned as Fifth Harmonyโ€s breakout star (and earned a spot in Taylor Swiftโ€s squad). To this set, Ms. Kordeiโ€s answer was apparently insufficiently effusive. โ€Camila is a lot more than cute and quirky sheโ€s kind, classy, mature and hardworking,โ€ one fan tweeted. The backlash soon grew big enough to hit the teen gossip sites (โ€OMG: Did Normani Kordei Throw Shade at Camila Cabello?โ€ the magazine   asked) before curdling into something more sinister. In fan enclaves across the web, a subset of Fifth Harmony followers called Ms. Kordei โ€Normonkey,โ€ โ€coon,โ€ and โ€nigger. โ€ One said she โ€deserves to be lynched. โ€ Another Photoshopped her face onto the body of a woman hanging from a tree. This is the kind of rhetoric you expect to see on 4chanโ€s political message board, a den of white supremacist rhetoric fused with ironic memes. The trolls of 4chan have lately helped power the online presence of the   the folks who led the Twitter assault against Ms. Jones. Now the internetโ€s most unruly celebrity fans are cribbing their troublemaking tactics from the same playbook. The firestorm against Ms. Jones was touched off by a nasty review of โ€Ghostbustersโ€ published by Milo Yiannopoulos, a conservative provocateur. As the attacks built, comment threads unspooled inside 4chan, surfacing racist images and commentary to hurl at Ms. Jones in Twitterโ€s open marketplace. Abuse against Ms. Kordei was organized, too, by an anonymous Twitter account that popped up directing fans to inundate her with slurs. Trolls thrive off provoking a response from their targets. When Ms. Jones began speaking out against the abuse on Twitter, 4chan posters traded gleeful messages. Fans, too, delight in forging some connection with the stars, even if it comes in the form of a rebuke. The abuse against Ms. Kordei escalated after she took to Twitter to deny a feud with Ms. Cabello and to denounce the fans attempting to stir up trouble. That behavior eventually scored a response from Ms. Cabello, too. โ€You donโ€t have to hate on somebody else to support me  โ€”   I donโ€t appreciate it and itโ€s not what Iโ€m about,โ€ she tweeted. โ€Be kind or move on. โ€ Most Fifth Harmony fans, who call themselves Harmonizers, are not racists. As the abuse mounted, support for Ms. Kordei poured out under the hashtags #IStandWithNormani and #WeLoveYouNormani. Still, racially tinged remarks about Ms. Kordei have been a   presence amid her rise in popularity  โ€”   fans have expressed surprise that she reads books and called her โ€uglyโ€ and โ€apeโ€ โ€”   and the abuse tends to flare at dramatic moments within the roiling fan narrative of imagined alliances and feuds (like the supposed ongoing beef between Ms. Kordei and Ms. Cabello). A similar dynamic has played out among One Direction fans, some of whom have greeted Zayn Malik, the groupโ€s lone Muslim member, with death threats and slurs like โ€terrorist. โ€ He briefly quit Twitter in 2012, citing Islamophobia, and left the band last year. And when Robert Pattinson started dating the singer FKA Twigs in 2014, a subgroup of his fans inundated her with racist abuse on Twitter that left her โ€genuinely shocked and disgusted. โ€ Some level of infighting is embedded within pop fandom itself. Like One Direction before it, Fifth Harmony is a   pop group thatโ€s been perfectly primed to exploit differences in personality, style and ethnic background of the groupโ€s singers. The Spice Girls played this trick most baldly, naming and dressing members after a singular trait  โ€”   Baby, Scary, Sporty, Posh and Ginger. But supporting a favorite bandmate can easily degrade into trashing a least favorite. In a New York Post article from 1998, one    Spice Girls fan said of Ginger (Geri Halliwell): โ€A lot of people donโ€t like her. I think some people hate her the most out of all of them. โ€ She added: โ€I personally donโ€t like Scary Spice, though. โ€ Typically, girl group loyalism falls into the benign end of human  . But in the crucible of online fandom, demographic distinctions can coarsen into warring factions. A fan fantasy that frames the band members as hating one another  โ€”   and paints one of them as rude, stupid, evil, and deserving of death because she is black  โ€”   is no longer just idle fan fictions. As Ms. Kordei put it in one of her notes to fans, โ€For those of you who enjoy speculating creating drama that doesnโ€t exist, please keep in mind that myself and the other girls in the group are PEOPLE. โ€ She added: โ€This is our story so let us write it our way, instead of you trying to write it for us. โ€",0
154,A Newly Vibrant Washington Fears That Trump Will Drain Its Culture - The New York Times,Jason Horowitz,"WASHINGTON  โ€”   Michelle Obama has burned off her   meals at Washingtonโ€s new generation of acclaimed restaurants by pedaling at SoulCycle. President Obama has shopped for Jonathan Franzen novels with his daughters at local independent bookstores. Obama administration staff members, their barhopping chronicled in the gossip pages, have hit the 14th Street hot spots hard. Decades ago, Washington was broke and run by a mayor best known for smoking crack with a friend on a surveillance tape. Neighborhoods had not fully recovered from the 1968 riots, and an aging Georgetown elite still set the tone. The administrations of two Bushes and a Clinton in between hardly had an effect on the city. But Mr. Obamaโ€s arrival in 2009 coincided with an urban renaissance. Economic development, federal and private investment, and an influx of highly educated young, gay and diverse professionals gentrified neighborhoods, leading to an explosion in restaurants, bars and cafes. And the Obama family  โ€”     youthful, attractive and urbane  โ€”   were archetypes of a modern city on the upswing. What the effect on Washington will be when Donald J. Trump moves into the White House is hard to predict. But many Washingtonians fear the worst. Among them is Vincent Gray, the cityโ€s mayor during much of the Obama administration. โ€Iโ€m worried about people not wanting to come here because of the image they have of the Trump administration,โ€ Mr. Gray said. Now a member of the City Council, Mr. Gray said the engagement of Mr. Obama and his family with the city has been โ€tremendously uplifting. โ€ โ€Their presence in the city brought a level of dynamism that just wasnโ€t there before,โ€ he said. By contrast, Mr. Trump seems unlikely to drop in at Oyamel, the Mexican restaurant and Obama favorite owned by Josรฉ Andrรฉs, a star chef and devoted Trump critic. For that matter, it is even unclear whether Mr. Trump, who has used his new Trump International Hotel as an outpost here, will spend weekends in the White House or in New York. And he is unlikely to feel a debt of gratitude to a city where Hillary Clinton won 93 percent of the vote. โ€D. C. is going to take a really hard hit, culturally, socially, everything. We were really finding our footing we werenโ€t second to New York,โ€ said Jazmine Johnson, a graphic designer who said she now planned to move to New York. Ms. Johnson, 25, was speaking in the Coffee Bar, a fashionable cafe on M Street where Mr. Trumpโ€s   โ€You Canโ€t Always Get What You Want,โ€ played in the background. In the aftermath of Mr. Trumpโ€s election victory on Tuesday, she sought solace in caffeine. Others around town signed up for free   sessions at yoga studios, or meditated on emails from their progressive rabbis reminding them of the Jewish mantra โ€Od lo avda tikvateinu,โ€ or, โ€We have not yet lost our hope. โ€ Reports abounded of federal workers and nonprofit employees crying at their desks, scanning the web for    rentals or accepting the free hugs on offer in Farragut Square. โ€The world has definitely shifted on its axis, and weโ€ve taken a step into the abyss,โ€ said Michael Steel, an establishment Republican by virtue of having worked for former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and departed House Speaker John Boehner, and a frequent critic of Mr. Trump. Mr. Gray said he worried that a Trump administration could set the city back because the federal government still controls its purse strings and could enact abortion restrictions, cut vital investment and relax gun control laws. But Democrats now in the government and thinking of leaving it, and young people who had hopes of joining it, have a more immediate concern  โ€”   a job. Meredith Lightstone, 21, who led the University of Marylandโ€s Terps for Hillary club, had been preparing her rรฉsumรฉ for positions in a Clinton administration. She said she had no interest in a role in the Trump White House. โ€Do I go into government or politics, or another route? Maybe tech?โ€ she asked. โ€T. B. D. โ€ At least some Washington institutions are likely to remain shockproof. The lucrative real estate market seems to be one. Andrew C. Florance, a Washington resident and founder of CoStar, a provider of data, marketing and analytic services to the commercial real estate industry, said he expected a wave of โ€glitzierโ€ New Yorkers  โ€”   โ€the Delta Shuttle crewโ€  โ€”   to join the Trump administration and quickly become part of the cityโ€s lobbying ranks and downtown neighborhoods. โ€It will be a terrific real estate market,โ€ he said. Lobbying firms on K Street are already treating Mr. Trumpโ€s election as a bonanza and are gearing up for more work. Conservative think tanks are looking forward to serving up new ideas to Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress. James Wallner, a vice president for research at the Heritage Foundation, said Mr. Trumpโ€s election was met with  . โ€Trump is a change agent,โ€ Mr. Wallner said. โ€As long as everyone is trying to change Washington, thatโ€s all that matters. โ€ Liberal and environmental groups are determined to stay and fight. Debbie Sease, who heads lobbying for the Sierra Club, presided over a   office of employees who took silent Metro rides into work last week and hung โ€free hugsโ€ signs on their desks. She expects an invigorated resistance to come to Washington, bringing moral outrage as well as sophisticated palates. โ€Iโ€d be surprised if all the good restaurants disappear or become steakhouses,โ€ she said. Cork, the wine bar that pioneered 14th Streetโ€s restaurant boom during the Obama years, set up televisions for an election night watch party. It turned into a   tragedy with the owner, Diane Gross, telling her mother to calm down or she would have a heart attack. Jen Psaki, the White House communications director, had her engagement party at Cork, Mrs. Obama dropped in, and Jill Biden became a regular there. Ms. Gross said she hoped that Washington, despite its reputation as a transitory place, had reached a cultural critical mass that would prevent   hemorrhaging of the young, fashionable and talented. Still, she acknowledged, โ€thereโ€s a real possibility of people going back to wherever they are from to do progressive politics there. โ€ Mike Oโ€Malley, an owner of the Red Hen, a popular restaurant in the recently gentrified neighborhood of Bloomingdale, said he expected his patrons to stay put. โ€There are things that make people want to live here besides government,โ€ he said, as diners commiserated at the bar over Mrs. Clintonโ€s loss. โ€People are living here as opposed to working here. โ€ Mr. Trump must now populate the federal government with new appointees, but some members of his inner circle are already entrenched in Washington. Stephen K. Bannon, whom Mr. Trump named chief strategist and senior counsel on Sunday, lives, works and entertains out of a   townhouse near the Supreme Court. David Bossie, another key aide to Mr. Trump, runs Citizens United, a conservative advocacy group, out of a Capitol Hill townhouse. And there will be newcomers like Richard B. Spencer, who took a break from reveling with other ecstatic supporters in the lobby bar of the Trump International Hotel on election night to declare the party over for the Washington establishment. โ€We are winners and we have displaced them,โ€ said Mr. Spencer, a leader of the โ€ โ€ movement who champions white identity politics and is currently looking for Beltway headquarters for his movement. He added, โ€We want to become the new establishment. โ€",0
155,Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady and Plans Slower Increases - The New York Times,Binyamin Appelbaum,"WASHINGTON  โ€”   The Federal Reserve is struggling to adapt to an economy that refuses to boom. The Fed said on Wednesday, after a   meeting of its   committee, that it would not raise its benchmark interest rate, and that future increases were most likely to unfold at a slower pace. The   period since the end of the Great Recession has become one of the longest economic expansions in American history and, at the same time, one of the most disappointing. The Fed, in a statement announcing its decision, noted what had become a typical mix of good news and bad. Economic output has increased while job growth has slowed, the Fed said. Consumers are spending more while companies are making fewer investments. Exports are rebounding, but Britainโ€s June 23 referendum on whether to leave the European Union could set off another round of disruptions. โ€Recent economic indicators have been mixed, suggesting that our cautious approach to adjusting monetary policy remains appropriate,โ€ the Fed chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, told a news conference. The decision to wait was unanimous. Even Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, who voted to raise rates at the Fedโ€s last few meetings, agreed this time that the moment was not ripe. โ€The labor market appears to have slowed down, and we need to assure ourselves that the underlying momentum in the economy has not diminished,โ€ Ms. Yellen said. Investors already are heavily discounting the chances of a rate increase at the Fedโ€s next meeting in July, or at the following meeting in September. Those chances, derived from asset prices, stood at 12 percent and 28 percent respectively on Wednesday, according to the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In this environment of tepid growth and weak inflation, Fed officials once again dialed back their expectations for future rate increases. The Fed in December had predicted four rate increases this year. On Wednesday, the Fed released new projections showing that 15 of its 17 policy makers now expected no more than two increases this year, and six of those officials predicted just one. Even more striking, the median prediction of Fed officials was that the central bankโ€s benchmark rate would rise to just 2. 4 percent by the end of 2018, down from the March median of 3 percent. That suggests officials increasingly regard mediocre global economic growth as an enduring malaise. The Fed also appears increasingly open to the view that a shift in basic economic dynamics, driven by factors like lower productivity growth and an aging population, is holding down interest rates. That means low rates are less stimulative than they would have been in earlier eras. โ€It means that long rates can remain low without causing the economy to overheat, and therefore the urgency of tightening is very substantially diminished,โ€ said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist. Markets are even more pessimistic than the Fed. The yield on the benchmark   Treasury fell to 1. 574 percent, the lowest level since 2012. That is part of a broader decline in global rates that, in recent days, also has sent the yield on   German debt below zero for the first time. Equity markets, which in recent years have often celebrated when central banks hold down rates, also declined modestly on Wednesday. The Standard  Poorโ€s   index fell 0. 18 percent to close at 2, 071. 50. Fed officials increasingly think the economy has exited its postcrisis period, according to economic projections the central bank published on Wednesday. The recovery, in other words, may not be complete, but it is over. Most officials predicted stable growth around 2 percent over the next few years, and they foresaw little if any additional decline in the unemployment rate, which fell to 4. 7 percent in May, the lowest level unemployment had reached since 2007, before the recession. But economic growth has disappointed expectations, and the Fedโ€s benchmark rate remains in a range between 0. 25 and 0. 5 percent after a single rate increase last December. As recently as late May, Ms. Yellen predicted the Fed would raise rates in โ€the coming months. โ€ On Wednesday, she downgraded a summer move to โ€not impossible. โ€ Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins University and a former adviser to Ms. Yellen, said the Fed was standing still because the basic economic situation had been remarkably stable. For the last several years, the labor market has gradually improved while inflation has been sluggish. โ€I suspect that the core policy developments have never been so static for so long,โ€ Mr. Faust wrote. Under those circumstances it makes perfect sense for the Fed to watch and wait. Consumer spending has driven domestic economic growth, and Ms. Yellen said she expected the trend to continue on the back of job growth and rising wages. But Fed officials were surprised by the slow pace of job growth in May, when the economy was estimated to have added just 38, 000 jobs. And a Fed index that summarizes labor market conditions has fallen to the lowest level in seven years. Officials also have expressed increased concern about inflation expectations, which play a significant role in determining future inflation. (Workers, for example, may seek larger raises if they expect prices to rise more quickly.) The University of Michiganโ€s consumer survey reported last week that consumers expected 2. 3 percent annual inflation in five years, the lowest level in the surveyโ€s history. Ms. Yellen emphasized again on Wednesday that Fed officials also saw significant risks in moving too quickly. Because interest rates already are low, the Fed has little room to ease conditions if growth falters. Officials say it will be easier to respond to faster inflation than to an economic downturn. Some economists see evidence that the Fed itself is playing a role in the slowdown. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time since the financial crisis, and officials have made clear that they would like to keep raising rates. Moreover, the decline in the Fedโ€s projection of   interest rates suggests that the Fed may have underestimated the impact of its actions in December. But Ms. Yellen said on Wednesday that the Fedโ€s move in December amounted to a small adjustment in rates, and that she did not agree with critics that it had an outsize impact. โ€I really donโ€t think that a single rate increase in December has had much significance for the outlook,โ€ she said.",0
156,The Battle at UNESCO,Ari Lieberman,"The Muslim Bloc may have won the battle, but did Israel win the war? October 28, 2016 Ari Lieberman 
By now it should be clear to all but the blindest (or rabidly disingenuous) that the United Nations is an organization that has been co-opted by the nefarious interests of Muslim nations and their despotic third world allies. It is an organization rife with prejudice and hypocrisy. An organization that can undeniably and without equivocation be described as today's greatest purveyor of Judeophobia, historical revisionism and conspiracy theories. This fact is best illustrated by three resolutions passed this year by United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that deny the indisputable Jewish nexus to the holy city. 
On April 12, the 58-member body voted in favor of an asinine and wholly one-sided resolution that referred to Jewish holy sites in Jerusalem exclusively by their Muslim names and designated the Temple Mount, Judaismโ€s holiest site, as a โ€Muslim holy site of worship.โ€ To add insult to injury, the resolution also adopted wild conspiracy theories including a claim that Israel was โ€planting Jewish fake graves in other spaces of the Muslim cemeteries.โ€ 
Unsurprisingly, the resolution, which was submitted by seven Muslim nations, passed by a wide margin with 33 votes in favor, six against and 17 abstentions. Two nations were absent for the vote. France, Sweden, Slovenia and Spain shamefully supported the vile resolution. 
That the resolution would pass was never in doubt given the large number of Muslim and despotic third world nations that constitute the makeup of UNESCO but it was hoped that the resolution would fail to garner European support and Israel could thus claim a moral victory. France with its collaborationist past and proclivity to kowtow to the worldโ€s despots did not disappoint and predictably voted with the rabble. 
But following the vote, a crack appeared in the faรงade of anti-Israel invective so prevalent at the U.N. It appeared that France was having a case of buyerโ€s remorse. In an address to the French parliament, Prime Minister Manuel Valls termed the resolution โ€clumsyโ€ and โ€unfortunate.โ€ He then added in rather sharp and pointed terms that โ€France will never deny the Jewish presence and Jewish history in Jerusalem. It would make no sense; it is absurd to deny this history.โ€ 
France is one of Europeโ€s strongest advocates for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority and their Muslim allies at UNESCO should have understood from Vallsโ€ statement that future resolutions with similar toxic content would no longer enjoy automatic European support. Instead of declaring victory and moving on, they pressed their luck by introducing another vile resolution in October. 
The October 13 resolution , sponsored by the usual suspects contained nearly identical language as the April resolution. It condemned Israel for various contrived transgressions and again severed the Jewish (and Christian) nexus to the city. This time however, the Muslim bloc was in for a rude awakening. While the resolution passed, the Muslim bloc was unable to garner a majority in the 58-member body. 
Of the 24 nations that voted in favor of the resolution (Mexico later withdrew support lowering the final tally to 23), 14 were composed of states with Muslim majorities while a fifteenth, Nigeria, is 50 percent Muslim, making passage of the resolution a forgone conclusion. What was notable was the fact that this time around, the resolution failed to garner a single western European concurrence. Other developing nations, like India, which had hitherto supported Arab-sponsored drafts also abstained. Israelโ€s behind-the-scenes political offensive aimed at exposing the lunacy of the Muslim initiative was paying dividends. 
Following the resolutionโ€s passage, the Palestinians and their Muslim allies suffered additional political reversals. Mexico , asked for a revote because it wished to withdraw support for the motion. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that his governmentโ€s changed position โ€reiterates the recognition that the Government of Mexico gives the undeniable link of the Jewish people to the cultural heritage of East Jerusalem.โ€ 
Brazil soon followed suit echoing Mexicoโ€s position. In a statement, the Brazilian government noted that it would no longer support such one-sided resolutions. Italy, which had abstained, went one step further and announced that it would actively oppose such resolutions in the future. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi told an Italian radio station that these resolutions were โ€incomprehensible, unacceptable and wrong.โ€ He added that โ€to say that the Jews have no links to Jerusalem is like saying the sun creates darkness.โ€ 
Even UNESCOโ€s director-general, Irina Bokova voiced disapproval by stating that โ€the heritage of Jerusalem is indivisible, and each of its communities has a right to the explicit recognition of their history and relationship with the city.โ€ She later received death threats for voicing objection to the motion. 
On Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan introduced a third draft resolution to UNESCOโ€s World Heritage Committee seeking to generate further political terrorism. The proposed resolution once again attempted to sever the Jewish nexus to the city and its holy sites. The 21-member WHC body was expected to pass the resolution by consensus but in a surprise move, Croatia and Tanzania asked for a secret ballot which infuriated the Muslim bloc. Instead of the motion passing by consensus, the vote was 10 in favor, two opposed, eight abstentions and one nation absent. 
The two nations opposing were Tanzania and the Philippines. Of the 10 ayes, seven were Muslim. It was a pyrrhic victory at best. 
Given the large number of Muslim countries represented at the U.N. and the hostility that most of these nations harbor against Israel, it is a virtual certainty that toxic resolutions of this nature will continue to be sponsored and passed. But as evidenced by recent Arab political reversals, gone are the days that the Palestinians can rely on automatic European and non-aligned support. 
Israel has been effectively reaching out to the so-called non-aligned nations and it is having a significant positive impact. Part of the Israeli success lies in the fact that the Jewish state has much to offer these nations in the fields of water technology, agriculture, energy, counter-terrorism, cyber warfare and arms. This outreach has translated to political dividends at the U.N. 
Nevertheless, the UNESCO resolutions serve to highlight the noxious nature and malevolence of many U.N. member states. It also underscores the need for the United States to maintain its commitment and assurance to Israel that it will never allow the U.N. to impose terms and dictates on Israel. 
There have been rumors circulating that Barack Obama in his twilight months would seek to impose a deleterious settlement on Israel utilizing the UN Security Council. The White House has remained uncharacteristically mute on the subject raising fears that there may be some merit to the speculation. 
The administrationโ€s objective would be accomplished by actively supporting a proposed anti-Israel resolution, likely introduced by France, or by choosing to abstain rather than exercising a veto. In addition to betraying long-standing commitments to Israel and running counter to strong bipartisan opposition, the notion that the United States would throw Israel under the bus and allow those who engage in despotism and blatant anti-Semitism to have a say on Israelโ€s fate, is beyond asinine. Hopefully, the outrageous conduct exhibited at UNESCO steers the administration in the right direction.",1
157,The Latest Test for the White House? Pulling Off Its Easter Egg Roll - The New York Times,Julie Hirschfeld Davis,"WASHINGTON  โ€”   President Trump received an urgent warning in February, informing him of a crucial date he was about to miss. โ€FYI manufacturing deadlines for the Easter eggs are near,โ€ said a Twitter post directed at Mr. Trump the first lady, Melania Trump and the presidentโ€s daughter Ivanka Trump. โ€Please reach out!โ€ The message came from Wells Wood Turning  Finishing, the company that supplies commemorative wooden eggs for the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, the    celebration that has drawn 35, 000 people to the South Lawn in recent years. The staff of the company, based in Buckfield, Me. wondered whether the Trumps planned to continue distributing the wooden eggs as party favors, or whether they were even going to have a White House Easter Egg Roll at all. By early March, the White House announced that the roll was on  โ€”   Monday, to be exact  โ€”   and soon followed up with a rush order for the wooden eggs. By that time, the ovoid uncertainty had raised a question perhaps not as consequential as investigations into Russian interference in the presidential election, a legally dubious travel ban and a collapsed health care bill, but no less a window into the inner workings of the Trump administration: Could this White House, plagued by slow hiring and lacking an   first lady, manage to pull off the largest, most elaborate and most heavily scrutinized public event of the year? โ€Itโ€s the single most   event that takes place at the White House each year, and the White House and the first lady are judged on how well they put it on,โ€ said Melinda Bates, who organized eight years of Easter Egg Rolls as director of the White House Visitors Office under President Bill Clinton. โ€Iโ€m really concerned for the Trump people, because they have failed to fill some really vital posts, and this thing is all hands on deck. โ€ White House party catastrophes have been the stuff of presidential nightmares in the past. During his first year in office, President Barack Obama drew harsh criticism for lax security procedures after a pair of aspiring   celebrities successfully crashed a state dinner honoring the prime minister of India, with one of them managing to buttonhole Mr. Obama for a handshake. The late start in planning by the Trump White House points to a smaller and less ambitious Egg Roll than in previous years. There may be half as many guests, a fraction of the number of volunteers to manage the invasion of the South Lawn, and military bands in place of   entertainers like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Idina Menzel and Silentรณ who have performed for Egg Rolls past. White House officials did not respond to several weeksโ€ worth of inquiries about the Easter Egg Roll, typically a heavily and enthusiastically promoted affair, and declined to provide basic information such as how many people are expected to attend. It is unclear, for instance, whether Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, will reprise his appearance in a bunny suit for the event, as he did a decade ago when George W. Bush was president and Mr. Spicer was an aide in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. Stephanie Grisham, who started as Mrs. Trumpโ€s communications director on Monday, had previously denied that the event was being scaled back from past years. But she acknowledged on Tuesday that attendance this year would be โ€a bit less,โ€ based on feedback from former officials who had said โ€the event had become so large that many children were not able to enjoy the planned activities. โ€ โ€Our team has been working very hard to make this yearโ€s event a success,โ€ Ms. Grisham said. โ€I am confident that the success of this yearโ€s Easter Egg Roll will speak for itself. โ€ The evidence points to a quickly   affair that people close to the planning said would probably draw about 20, 000 people  โ€”   substantially smaller than last yearโ€s Easter Egg Roll, which drew 37, 000. It will be staffed by 500 volunteers, Ms. Grisham said, half the usual. Ms. Grisham said she did not have โ€firm numbersโ€ on the overall number of attendees, and those who provided estimates did so on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to describe the plans for the Easter Egg Roll, which are still evolving just a week before the event. The White House has ordered 40, 000 of the commemorative eggs  โ€”   about half of the roughly 85, 000 ordered in 2016  โ€”   with 18, 000 to be given away at the Easter Egg Roll and another 22, 000 available for sale, according to Lara Kline, the vice president for marketing and communications at the White House Historical Association, the official retailer. The relatively small number, Ms. Kline said, โ€is due to the limited manufacturing window for this yearโ€s Easter Egg Roll. โ€ The employees at Wells Wood Turning were not alone in wondering whether the White House would ever get in touch.   public schools that normally receive blocks of tickets for as many as 4, 000 children have yet to hear from the White House, according to representatives for school systems in the District of Columbia Arlington, Va. and Alexandria, Va. Several groups representing military families, who have accounted for as many as 3, 000 guests in recent years, also said they had yet to be contacted. โ€Iโ€ve had quite a few families from across the country reach out and say: โ€Hey, are we getting tickets? Our family wants to drive in for the event,โ€โ€ said Ashley   the president of the American Military Partner Association, which represents the families of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender service members and has received tickets for five to 10 of them for each of the last several years. โ€Unfortunately, the Trump administration has not reached out about it. โ€ But Ms. Grisham said on Tuesday that tickets had been set aside for schools, childrenโ€s hospitals and military families. She could not say how many. Even Curious George and Elmo did not know for sure that the Easter Egg Roll was happening until late last month, when the White House first contacted PBS Kids to ask if it could provide costumed characters. โ€We just got word about this yearโ€s Egg Roll and are working on planning,โ€ Jennifer Rankin Byrne, the senior director of media relations for PBS, said on March 20. The Easter Egg Roll has been crowded in past years with cast members from โ€Sesame Street,โ€ but this year, there will be a lone emissary. โ€PBS asked us to participate with them, and we agreed to provide a โ€Sesame Streetโ€ character,โ€ said Elizabeth Weinreb Fishman, the vice president for strategic communications for Sesame Workshop. She declined to say which character would attend, referring questions to the White House. Members of Congress have not received word from the White House about whether they will get tickets to distribute to their constituents. One aide to a Republican lawmaker said White House officials โ€seem to be a bit behind schedule. โ€ Nor have the organizers of the Yoga Garden featured on the South Lawn during   Easter Egg Rolls been asked to share their asanas. โ€No one has reached out to me about the 2017 event,โ€ said Leah Cullis, the yogi who coordinated the Yoga Garden for all eight of the Obamasโ€ Easter Egg Rolls. Mrs. Trump, who lives in New York and has had a limited presence in Washington since her husband was sworn in, has been slow to hire a staff for the East Wing, which typically takes the lead on the Easter Egg Roll. She named a chief of staff and social secretary in early February but has yet to announce a director for the Visitors Office, normally the crucial player in the daunting execution of the event. โ€You donโ€t understand what a beast this thing is to plan until you go and plan your first one,โ€ said Ellie Schafer, who organized Easter Egg Rolls for the Obamas as the director of the White House Visitors Office from 2009 to 2016. โ€Every administration tries to put its own stamp on it, but the stakes are high because itโ€s such a Washington tradition, and people just love it and have very strong feelings about it. โ€ Ms. Bates, whose memoir โ€White House Storyโ€ documents the challenges of planning   Easter Egg Rolls, said the event was a window  โ€”   up to a point  โ€”   into the competence of an administration. โ€If you can pull off an Easter Egg Roll,โ€ she said, โ€you can do anything. โ€",0

The Secret Service confirmed it interviewed Lowrey and is still investigating the incident, the New York Daily News reported. Lowrey posted the Tweet Jan. 17, three days before Trumpโ€s inauguration. The Tweet disappeared not long after it was posted, along with all her social media accounts. The bio on her profile said she was a โ€a Louisville Vixen and aspiring WWE divaโ€ before the account was taken down, the Daily News reported. No charges have been announced against her yet, but her former employers have already issued statements denouncing the Tweet and have severed ties with her, WAVE reported. Va Va Vixens, a burlesque group in Louisville, let Lowrey go as soon as they found out about the incident, citing a โ€zero tolerance policyโ€ for her behavior. โ€We do not condone hate by any party and will not partake in it.

159,What the Clintons Did to Haiti,Nathan J. Robinson,"Tweet Widget by Nathan J. Robinson 
Bill and Hillary Clintonโ€s role in the โ€remakingโ€ of Haiti after a devastating earthquake and foreign occupation is โ€indefensible,โ€ according to the authorโ€s article, โ€Superpredator: Bill Clintonโ€s Use and Abuse of Black America,โ€ from which this piece is excerpted. โ€Many Clinton projects โ€have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the islandโ€s ruling elite.โ€ Other projects simply fizzled. โ€The money donated and invested was extraordinary, but nobody seems to know where it has gone.โ€ What the Clintons Did to Haiti by Nathan J. Robinson 
This article previously appeared in Global Research and Current Affairs . 
โ€She intended to โ€make Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.โ€โ€ 
Bill and Hillary Clinton had long shared a personal interest in Haiti, dating back to the time of their honeymoon, part of which was spent in Port-au-Prince. In his autobiography, Bill says that his understanding of God and human nature were profoundly transformed when they witnessed a voodoo ceremony in which a woman bit the head off a live chicken. Hillary Clinton says the two of them โ€fell in loveโ€ with Haiti and they had developed a โ€deep connectionโ€ to the country. So when Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State in 2009, she consciously made the redevelopment of Haiti one of her top priorities. The country, she announced, would be a laboratory where the United States could โ€road-test new approaches to development,โ€ taking advantage of what she termed โ€the power of proximity.โ€ She intended to โ€make Haiti the proving ground for her vision of American power.โ€ Hillary Clinton selected her own chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to run the Haiti project. 
Mills would be joined by Bill Clinton, who had been deputized by the U.N. as a โ€special envoyโ€ to Haiti. Billโ€s role was not well-defined, and Haitians were curious about what was in store. Mills wrote in an email to Hillary Clinton that Haitians saw Billโ€s appointment as โ€a step toward putting Haiti in a protectorate or trusteeship status.โ€ Soon, โ€joking that he must be coming back to lead a new colonial regime,โ€ the Haitian media โ€ dubbed him Le Gouverneur.โ€ 
The project was heavily focused on increasing Haitiโ€s appeal to foreign corporations. As Politico reported , Clintonโ€s experiment โ€had business at its center: Aid would be replaced by investment, the growth of which would in turn benefit the United States.โ€ 
โ€Clinton announced that Haiti would be a laboratory where the United States could road-test new approaches to development, taking advantage of โ€the power of proximity.โ€โ€ 
One of the first acts in the new โ€business-centeredโ€ Haiti policy involved suppressing Haitiโ€s minimum wage. A 2009 Haitian law raised the minimum wage to 61 cents an hour, from 24 cents an hour previously. Haitian garment manufacturers, including contractors for Hanes and Levi Strauss, were furious, insisting that they were only willing to agree to a seven-cent increase. The manufacturers approached the U.S. State Department, who brought intense pressure to bear against Haitian President Renรฉ Prรฉval, working to โ€aggressively blockโ€ the 37-cent increase. The U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase โ€did not take economic reality into accountโ€ and simply โ€appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.โ€ But as Ryan Chittum of the Columbia Journalism Review explained , the proposed wage increase would have been only the most trivial additional expense for the American garment manufacturers: 
โ€As of last year Hanes had 3,200 Haitians making t-shirts for it. Paying each of them two bucks a day more would cost it about $1.6 million a year. Hanesbrands Incorporated made $211 million on $4.3 billion in sales last year, and presumably it would pass on at least some of its higher labor costs to consumers. Or better yet, Hanesbrands CEO Richard Noll could forego some of his rich compensation package. He could pay for the raises for those 3,200 t-shirt makers with just one-sixth of the $10 million in salary and bonus he raked in last year.โ€ 
โ€U.S. Deputy Mission Chief said a minimum-wage increase โ€did not take economic reality into accountโ€ and simply โ€appealed to the unemployed and underpaid masses.โ€โ€ 
The truth of the โ€economic realityโ€ was that the Haitian undergarment sector was hardly likely to become wildly less competitive as a result of the increase. The effort to suppress the minimum wage was not solely a Clinton project. It was also a โ€concerted effort on the part of Haitian elites, factory owners, free trade proponents, U.S. politicians, economists, and American companies.โ€ But it was in keeping with the State Departmentโ€s priorities under Clinton, which prioritized creating a favorable business climate. It was that same familiar Clinton move โ€from aid to trade.โ€ Bill Clintonโ€s program for Haitian development, designed by Oxford University economist Paul Collier, โ€ had garment exports at its center.โ€ Collier wrote that because of โ€propitiousโ€ factors like โ€poverty and [a] relatively unregulated labor market, Haiti has labor costs that are fully competitive with China.โ€ But the Clintonsโ€ role in Haiti would soon expand even further. In 2010, the country was struck by the worst earthquake in its history. The disaster killed 160,000 people and displaced over 1.5 million more. (The consequences of the earthquake were exacerbated by the ruined state of the Haitian food economy, plus the concentration of unemployed Haitian farmers in Port-au-Prince.) Bill Clinton was soon put in charge of the U.S.-led recovery effort. He was appointed to head the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC), which would oversee a wide range of rebuilding projects. At President Obamaโ€s request, Clinton and George W. Bush created the โ€Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund,โ€ and began aggressively fundraising around the world to support Haiti in the earthquakeโ€s aftermath. (With Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State overseeing the efforts of USAID, the Clintonsโ€ importance to the recovery could not be overstated; Billโ€s appointment meant that โ€at every stage of Haitiโ€s reconstructionโ€”fundraising, oversight and allocationโ€”a Clinton was now involved.โ€ 
Despite appearances, the Clinton-Bush fund was not focused on providing traditional relief. As they wrote , โ€[w]hile other organizations in Haiti are using their resources to deliver immediate humanitarian aid, we are using our resources to focus on long-term development.โ€ While the fund would advertise that โ€100% of donations go directly to relief efforts,โ€ Clinton and Bush adopted an expansive definition of โ€reliefโ€ efforts, treating luring foreign investment and jobs as a crucial part of earthquake recovery. On their website, they spoke proudly of what the New York Daily News characterized as a program of โ€supporting longterm programs to develop Haitiโ€s business class.โ€ 
โ€At every stage of Haitiโ€s reconstructionโ€”fundraising, oversight and allocationโ€”a Clinton was now involved.โ€ 
The strategy was an odd one. Port-au-Prince had been reduced to ruin, and Haitians were crowded into filthy tent cities, where many were dying of a cholera outbreak (which had itself been caused by the negligence of the United Nations). Whatever value building new garment factories may have had as a longterm economic plan, Haitians were faced with somewhat more pressing concerns like the basic provision of shelter and medicine, as well as the clearing of the thousands of tons of rubble that filled their streets. 
The Clinton-led recovery was a disaster. A year after the earthquake, a stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clintonโ€s IHRC as creating a โ€quagmire of indecision and delayโ€ that had made little progress toward successful earthquake recovery. Oxfam found that: 
โ€โ€ฆless than half of the reconstruction aid promised by international donors has been disbursed. And while some of that money has been put toward temporary housing, almost none of the funds have been used for rubble removal.โ€ 
Instead, the Clinton Foundation, IHRC, and State Department created what a Wall Street Journal writer called โ€a mishmash of low quality, poorly thought-out development experiments and half-finished projects.โ€ Haitian IHRC members lamented that the commission had produced โ€a disparate bunch of approved projects. . . [that] do not address as a whole either the emergency situation or the recovery, let alone the development, of Haiti.โ€ A 2013 investigation by the Government Accountability Office found that most money for the recovery was not being dispersed, and that the projects that were being worked on were plagued by delays and cost overruns. Many Clinton projects were extravagant public relations affairs that quickly fizzled. For example, The Washington Post reported that : 
โ€โ€ฆ[a] 2011 housing expo that cost more than $2 million, including $500,000 from the Clinton Foundation, was supposed to be a model for thousands of new units but instead has resulted in little more than a few dozen abandoned model homes occupied by squatters.โ€ 
โ€ A stinging report from Oxfam singled out Clintonโ€s IHRC as creating a โ€quagmire of indecision and delay.โ€โ€ 
Other Clinton ventures were seen as โ€disconnected from the realities of most people in the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.โ€ Politico reported that many Clinton projects โ€have primarily benefited wealthy foreigners and the islandโ€s ruling elite, who needed little help to begin with.โ€ For example, โ€the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund invested more than $2 million in the Royal Oasis Hotel, where a sleek suite with hardwood floors costs more than $200 a night and the shops sell $150 designer purses and $120 menโ€s dress shirts.โ€ 
Predictably, the Royal Oasis didnโ€t do an especially roaring trade; The Washington Post reported that โ€[o]ne recent afternoon, the hotel appeared largely empty, and with tourism hardly booming five years after the quake, locals fear it may be failing.โ€ In a country with a 30-cent minimum wage, investing recovery dollars in a luxury hotel was not just offensive, but economically daft. Sometimes the recovery projects were accused not only of being pointless, but of being downright harmful. For instance, Bill Clinton had proudly announced that the Clinton Foundation would be funding the โ€construction of emergency storm shelters in Lรฉogรขne.โ€ But an investigation of the shelters that the Foundation had actually built found that they were โ€shoddy and dangerousโ€ and full of toxic mold. The Nation discovered , among other things, that the temperature in the shelters reached over 100 degrees, causing children to experience headaches and eye irritations (which may have been compounded by the mold), and that the trailers showed high levels of carcinogenic formaldehyde, linked to asthma and other lung diseases. The Clinton Foundation had subcontracted the building of the shelters to Clayton Homes, a firm that had already been sued in the United States by the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) for โ€having provided formaldehyde-laced trailers to Hurricane Katrina victims.โ€ (Clayton Homes was owned by Warren Buffett โ€s Berkshire Hathaway, and Buffett had been a longstanding major donor to the Clinton Foundation.) The Nation โ€s investigation reported on children whose classes were being held in Clinton Foundation trailers. Their semester had just been cut short, and the students sent home, because the temperature in the classrooms had grown unbearable. The misery of the students in the Clinton trailers was described: 
โ€Judith Seide, a student in Lubertโ€s sixth-grade class [explained that] she and her classmates regularly suffer from painful headaches in their new Clinton Foundation classroom. Every day, she said, her โ€head hurts and I feel it spinning and have to stop moving, otherwise Iโ€d fall.โ€ Her vision goes dark, as is the case with her classmate Judel, who sometimes canโ€t open his eyes because, said Seide, โ€heโ€s allergic to the heat.โ€ Their teacher regularly relocates the class outside into the shade of the trailer because the swelter inside is insufferable. Sitting in the sixth-grade classroom, student Mondialie Cineas, who dreams of becoming a nurse, said that three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day. โ€At noon, the class gets so hot, kids get headaches,โ€ the 12-year-old said, wiping beads of sweat from her brow. She is worried because โ€the kids feel sick, canโ€t work, canโ€t advance to succeed.โ€โ€ 
โ€Three times a week the teacher gives her and her classmates painkillers so that they can make it through the school day.โ€ 
The most notorious post-earthquake development project, however, was the Caracol industrial park . The park was pitched as a major job creator, part of the goal of helping Haiti โ€build back betterโ€ than it was before. The State Department touted the prospect of 100,000 new jobs for Haitians, with Hillary Clinton promising 65,000 jobs within five years. The industrial park followed the Clintonsโ€ preexisting development model for Haiti: public/private partnerships with a heavy emphasis on the garment industry. Even though there were still hundreds of thousands of evacuees living in tents, the project was based on โ€the more expansive view that, in a desperately poor country where traditional foreign aid has chronically failed, fostering economic development is as important as replacing what fell down.โ€ Much of the planning was focused on trying to lure a South Korean clothing manufacturer to set up shop there, by plying them with U.S. taxpayer funding. The Caracol project was โ€the centerpieceโ€ of the U.S.โ€s recovery effort. A gala celebrating its opening featured the Clintons and Sean Penn, and it was treated as the emblem of the new, โ€betterโ€ Haiti, that would demonstrate the countryโ€s commitment to being โ€open for business.โ€ In order to build the park, hundreds of poor farmers were evicted from their land, so that millions of dollars could be spent transforming it. 
But the project was a terrible disappointment. After four years, it was only operating at 10% capacity , and the jobs had failed to materialize : 
Far from 100,000 jobsโ€”or even the 60,000 promised within five years of the parkโ€s openingโ€” โ€Caracol currently employs just 5,479 people full time. That comes out to roughly $55,000 in investment per job created so far; or, to put it another way, about 30 times more per job than the average [Caracol] worker makes per year. The park, built on the site of a former U.S. Marine-run slave labor camp during the 1915-1934 U.S. occupation, has the best-paved roads and manicured sidewalks in the country, but most of the land remains vacant.โ€ 
Most of the seized farmland went unused, then, and even for the remaining farmers, โ€ surges of wastewater have caused floods and spoiled crops.โ€ Huge queues of unemployed Haitians stood daily in front of the factory, awaiting jobs that did not exist. The Washington Post described the scene: 
โ€Each morning, crowds line up outside the parkโ€s big front gate, which is guarded by four men in crisp khaki uniforms carrying shotguns. They wait in a sliver of shade next to a cinder-block wall, many holding rรฉsumรฉs in envelopes. Most said they have been coming every day for months, waiting for jobs that pay about $5 a day. From his envelope, Jean Mito Palvetus, 27, pulled out a diploma attesting that he had completed 200 hours of training with the U.S. Agency for International Development on an industrial sewing machine. โ€I have three kids and a wife, and I canโ€t support them,โ€ he said, sweating in the hot morning sun. โ€I have a diploma, but I still canโ€t get a job here. I still have nothing.โ€โ€ 
โ€ The interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.โ€ 
For some , the Caracol project perfectly symbolized the Clinton approach: big promises, an emphasis on sweatshops, incompetent management, and little concern for the actual impact on Haitians. โ€Caracol is a prime example of bad help,โ€ as one Haiti scholar put it . โ€The interests of the market, the interest of foreigners are prioritized over the majority of people who are impoverished in Haiti.โ€ 
But, failure as it may have been, the Caracol factory was among the more successful of the projects, insofar as it actually came into existence. A large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown. As Politico explained : 
โ€Even Billโ€s U.N. Office of the Special Envoy couldnโ€t track where all of [it] wentโ€”and the truth is that still today no one really knows how much money was spent โ€rebuildingโ€ Haiti. Many initial pledges never materialized. A whopping $465 million of the relief money went through the Pentagon, which spent it on deployment of U.S. troopsโ€”20,000 at the high water mark, many of whom never set foot on Haitian soil. That money included fuel for ships and planes, helicopter repairs and inscrutables such as an $18,000 contract for a jungle gymโ€ฆ Huge contracts were doled out to the usual array of major contractors, including a $16.7 million logistics contract whose partners included Agility Public Warehousing KSC, a Kuwaiti firm that was supposed to have been blacklisted from doing business with Washington after a 2009 indictment alleging a conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government during the Iraq War.โ€ 
The recovery under the Clintons became notorious for its mismanagement. Clinton staffers โ€ had no idea what Haiti was like and had no sensitivity to the Haitians.โ€ They were reportedly rude and condescending toward Haitians, even refusing to admit Haitian government ministers to meetings about recovery plans. While the Clintons called in high-profile consulting firms like McKinsey to draw up plans, they had little interest in listening to Haitians themselves. The former Haitian prime minister spoke of a โ€weakโ€ American staff who were โ€more interested in supporting Clinton than helping Haiti.โ€ 
โ€A large amount of the money raised by Bill Clinton after the earthquake, and pledged by the U.S. under Hillary Clinton, simply disappeared without a trace, its whereabouts unknown.โ€ 
One of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton, who wrote a detailed email to her parents in which she said that while Haitians were trying to help themselves, every part of the international aid effort, both governmental and nongovernmental, was falling short. โ€The incompetence is mind numbing,โ€ she wrote . Chelsea produced a detailed memorandum recommending drastic steps that needed to be taken in order to get the recovery on track. But the memo was kept within the Clinton family, released only later under a Freedom of Information Act disclosure of Hillaryโ€s State Department correspondence. If it had come out at the time, as Haiti journalist Jonathan Katz writes , it โ€would have obliterated the public narrative of helpful outsiders saving grateful earthquake survivors that her motherโ€s State Department was working so hard to promote.โ€ 
The Clintonsโ€ Haiti recovery ended with a whimper. The Clinton-Bush Haiti Fund distributed the last of its funds in 2012 and disbanded, without any attempt at further fundraising. The IHRC โ€ quietly closed their doorsโ€ in October of 2011, even though little progress had been made. As the Boston Review โ€s Jake Johnston explained , though hundreds of thousands remained displaced, the IHRC wiped its hands of the housing situation: 
โ€[L]ittle remained of the grand plans to build thousands of new homes. Instead, those left homeless would be given a small, one-time rental subsidy of about $500. These subsidies, funded by a number of different aid agencies, were meant to give private companies the incentive to invest in building houses. As efforts to rebuild whole neighborhoods faltered, the rental subsidies turned Haitians into consumers, and the housing problem was handed over to the private sector.โ€ 
The Clintons themselves simply stopped speaking about Haiti. After the first two years, they were โ€nowhere to be seenโ€ there, despite Hillaryโ€s having promised that her commitment to Haiti would long outlast her tenure as Secretary of State. Haiti has been given little attention during Hillary Clintonโ€s presidential campaign, even though the Haiti project was ostensibly one of great pride for both Clintons. 
โ€One of those shocked by the failure of the recovery effort was Chelsea Clinton.โ€ 
The widespread consensus among observers is that the Haiti recovery, which TIME called the U.S.โ€s โ€compassionate invasion,โ€ was a catastrophically mismanaged disappointment. Jonathan Katz writes that โ€itโ€s hard to find anyone these days who looks back on the U.S.-led response to the January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake as a success.โ€ While plenty of money was channeled into the country, it largely went to what were โ€little more than small pilot projectsโ€”a new set of basketball hoops and a model elementary school here, a functioning factory there.โ€ 
The end result has been that little has changed for Haiti. โ€Haitians find themselves in a social and economic situation that is worse than before the earthquake,โ€ reports a Belgian photojournalist who has spent 10 years in Haiti: 
โ€Everyone says that theyโ€re living in worse conditions than beforeโ€ฆ When you look at the history of humanitarian relief, thereโ€s never been a situation when such a small country has been the target of such a massive influx of money and assistance in such a short span of timeโ€ฆ On paper, with that much money in a territory the size of Haiti, we should have witnessed miracles; there should have been results.โ€ 
โ€If anything, they appear worse off,โ€ says Foreign Policy of Haitiโ€s farmers. โ€I really cannot understand how you could raise so much money, put a former U.S. president in charge, and get this outcome,โ€ said one Haitian official. Indeed, the money donated and invested was extraordinary. But nobody seems to know where it has gone. 
Haitians direct much of the blame toward the Clintons. As a former Haitian government official who worked on the recovery said , โ€[t]here is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. . .. They say that Clinton used Haiti.โ€ Haitians โ€ increasingly complain that Clinton-backed projects have often helped the countryโ€s elite and international business investors more than they have helped poor โ€Haitians.โ€ There is a โ€suspicion that their motives are more to make a profit in Haiti than to help it.โ€ And that while โ€striking a populist pose, in practice they were attracted to power in Haiti.โ€ 
But perhaps we should be more forgiving of the Clintonsโ€ conduct during the Haitian recovery. After all, instead of doing true harm, the Clintons simply failed to do much good. And perhaps itโ€s better to have a luxury hotel than not to have one, better to have a few jobs than none at all. Thanks to Bill Clinton, thereโ€s a gleaming new industrial park, albeit one operating at a fraction of its capacity. 
Yet itโ€s a mistake to measure Clinton against what would have happened if the United States had done nothing at all for Haiti. The question is what would have happened if a capable, nonfamous administrator, rather than a globetrotting narcissist, had been placed in charge. Tens of millions of dollars were donated toward the Haiti recovery by people across the world; it was an incredible outpouring of generosity. The squandering of that money on half-baked development schemes (mainly led by cronies ), and the ignoring of Haitiansโ€ own demands, mean that Clinton may have caused considerable harm through his failure. Plenty of people died in tent cities that would not have died if the worldโ€s donations had been used effectively. 
โ€Defending the Clintonsโ€ Haiti record is an impossible endeavor.โ€ 
Democrats have bristled at recent attempts by Donald Trump to criticize Hillary Clinton over her record in Haiti. Jonathan Katz, whose in-depth reporting from Haiti was stingingly critical of the Clintons, has now changed his tune , insisting that we all bear the responsibility for the failed recovery effort. When Trump accused the Clintons of squandering millions building โ€a sweatshopโ€ in Haiti in the form of the Caracol park, media fact-checkers quickly insisted he was spewing Pinocchios. The Washington Post said that while Clinton Foundation donors may have financially benefited from the factory-building project, they benefited โ€writ largeโ€ rather than โ€directly.โ€ The Post cited the words of the factoryโ€s spokesman as evidence that the factory was not a sweatshop, and pointed out that Caracol workers earned at least โ€minimum wageโ€ (failing to mention that minimum wage in Haiti remains well under a dollar). PolitiFact also rated the sweatshop claim โ€mostly false,โ€ even though Katz notes โ€long hours, tough conditions, and low payโ€ at the factory and PolitiFact acknowledges the โ€ongoing theft of legally-earned wages.โ€ 
Defending the Clintonsโ€ Haiti record is an impossible endeavor, one Democrats should probably not bother attempting. As the Center for Economic and Policy Research, which has studied the recovery, noted , when it comes to the Clinton-led recovery mission, โ€itโ€s hard to say itโ€s been anything other than a failure.โ€ Haitians are not delusional in their resentment of the Clintons; they have good reason to feel as if they were used for publicity, and discarded by the Clintons when they became inconvenient. 
None of this means that one should vote for Donald Trump for president. His tears for Haiti are those of a highly opportunistic crocodile, and his interest in the countryโ€s wellbeing began at the precise moment that it could be used a bludgeon with which to beat his political opponent. As we have previously noted in this publication , one does not need to be convinced that Hillary Clinton is an honorable person in order to be convinced that she is the preferable candidate. It is important, however, not to maintain any illusions, not to stifle or massage the truth in the service of short-term electoral concerns. It remains simultaneously true that a Clinton presidency is our present least-worst option and that what the Clintons did to Haiti was callous, selfish, and indefensible.",1
160,"For Cuomo and Christie, Parallel Paths to the Top, and Trouble When They Got There - The New York Times",Vivian Yee,"It might be hard to remember now, with one governor embroiled in a corruption scandal for the last three years and his counterpart across the Hudson River plunging headlong into another, but Chris Christie of New Jersey and Andrew M. Cuomo of New York were once lionized for relentlessly prosecuting bad behavior in government. The wars they waged against corrupt politicians, as the attorney general of New York (Mr. Cuomo) and the United States attorney for New Jersey (Mr. Christie) won them bipartisan kudos and, eventually, smooth ascents to their statesโ€ highest offices. After the ethical morasses that swamped figures such as former Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York and Alan Hevesi, the stateโ€s former comptroller, and former Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey in the 2000s, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie  โ€”   each a tough prosecutor with    White House aspirations  โ€”   looked more immaculate than ever. Those were the days. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, spent Thursday reeling at the arrest of one of his closest friends, confidants and former aides, as well as the arrests of several other close advisers and donors. Prosecutors had accused them of involvement in a   bribery scheme whose many grubby details included the fact that two of the governorโ€s former aides referred gleefully to corrupt payoffs as โ€ziti,โ€ ร  la โ€The Sopranos,โ€ and to one skittish ziti contributor as โ€fat boy. โ€ (As in: โ€Handle fat boy carefully. We donโ€t need an interruption in that Zitti delivery or else well really be up the creek. โ€) Over in New Jersey, Mr. Christie, a Republican, is up a very unpleasant creek of his own. A former top aide and a former political ally are on trial over their roles in the 2013 scandal that elevated a traffic jam on access lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge into an immortal symbol of political payback. Having helped puncture Mr. Christieโ€s presidential hopes earlier this year, the   episode later went on to help sink his bid to join the Donald J. Trump ticket. The trial, which began last Monday, has been no kinder to the governor: Prosecutors waited exactly zero days before asserting, during opening statements, that Mr. Christie knew three of his aides and allies were involved in the plot as it was unfolding. Neither governor is accused of breaking the law. But for two men who once prided themselves on managing    administrations, claiming to have been blind to alleged acts of petty revenge and bribery at the highest levels of state government seems bad enough. As they campaigned for the governorโ€s office, each promised to cut through what they called partisan nonsense, bureaucratic inertia and dodgy dealing to get real results for residents in their states. Each had the trophy case to back it up. As state attorney general, Mr. Cuomo took aim at the other two statewide elected officials, both fellow Democrats: Mr. Spitzer, whose administrationโ€s misuse of state troopers to target a political rival Mr. Cuomo helped uncover, and Mr. Hevesi, who went to prison after a Cuomo investigation found that he had accepted personal benefits in exchange for approving a state pension fund investment. In New Jersey, where Mr. Christie was appointed a United States attorney by President George W. Bush in 2002, the young prosecutor quickly dispelled questions about his readiness for the job by pursuing corruption charges against dozens of local officials and leading   inquiries that implicated several more. They were sane. Smart. Clean. Capable. Determined. And smug. โ€I am putting each and every one of you on notice,โ€ Mr. Christie said in a 2002 speech, taking aim at his home stateโ€s notoriously debased political culture. โ€We are going to root this stuff out, and I expect all of you to help me. โ€ By 2009, as a virtual political neophyte and a Republican in a blue state, he had managed to defeat the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Jon S. Corzine. โ€Job 1 is going to be to clean up Albany and make the government work for the people,โ€ Mr. Cuomo said in 2010, kicking off his campaign for governor on the steps of Manhattanโ€s Tweed Courthouse, New Yorkโ€s monument to   political corruption. (He also vowed to run the โ€most transparentโ€ administration in state history.) But as the fallout from each scandal has made clear, the professionalism and integrity of their offices were compromised almost from the start by aides and advisers who seemed far more interested in their own endgames  โ€”   whether political, financial or both  โ€”   than in serving a state. In both cases, they were empowered by Mr. Christie and Mr. Cuomo themselves. Each man had cultivated a small group of trusted advisers who, driven by unshakable tribal loyalty and a hunger to see their bosses taste the White House one day, enforced the governorโ€s will, punished his enemies and rewarded his friends. For Mr. Christie, they included Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, the two former officials currently on trial, and Bill Stepien, his former top lieutenant, an old friend and political operative who left ears ringing across New Jersey on the governorโ€s behalf. They met for strategy sessions around Mr. Christieโ€s kitchen table in Mendham and mingled at N. F. L. games. They worked together to single out local officials who supported the governorโ€s 2013   bid for perks and to mete out revenge to those who did not  โ€”   including Mayor Mark Sokolich of Fort Lee, N. J. a Democrat who, having declined to endorse the governor, got a catastrophic traffic jam in return, prosecutors say. Their equivalents in Albany were a group of stalwarts who had marched at Mr. Cuomoโ€s side, in some cases as far back as the administration of Mr. Cuomoโ€s father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who became governor in 1983. The men, and they were all men, even had a โ€term of endearmentโ€ for one another, according to the federal criminal complaint released on Thursday: โ€Herb. โ€ (It remains unclear why.) Chief among them was Joseph Percoco, who had started working for the elder Mr. Cuomo when he was 19. So high was his place in the family firmament that during Mr. Cuomoโ€s eulogy for his father in January 2015, he called Mr. Percoco โ€my fatherโ€s third son, who I sometimes think he loved the most. โ€ It was Mr. Percoco who, everyone in New Yorkโ€s political establishment understood, woke Mr. Cuomo up in the morning, dispensed threats for him during the day and put him to bed at night. It was also Mr. Percoco, working with another โ€Herbโ€ and former Cuomo aide, Todd R. Howe, who shook down a developer and an energy company for at least $315, 000 in bribes in exchange for putting his considerable power at their service, prosecutors say. There was the legal opinion that Mr. Percoco got reversed. The energy policy decisions, made by state experts, that he overrode. The $5, 700 raise, the criminal complaint says, that he berated   staff at the governorโ€s office into approving for the son of an executive who had paid him off. And there was the fact, apparent from the complaint, that no one in state government questioned his authority to do so. These days, there is no avoiding the central question: How could the governors not have known? Mr. Christie has said that while he took ultimate responsibility for the lane closings, it was impossible for him to keep tabs on 65, 000 state employees. He was โ€disturbed,โ€ he said, by Mr. Stepienโ€s behavior, while Ms. Kelly was โ€stupidโ€ and โ€a liar. โ€ Mr. Cuomo, too, has been moved to muse on personal betrayal. โ€The central plank of my administration has always been about public integrity and zero tolerance for any waste, fraud or abuse. If anything, I hold a friend to a higher standard,โ€ he said in Buffalo on Friday. โ€Itโ€s the first time since we lost my father that I didnโ€t miss him being here yesterday, because it wouldโ€ve broken his heart. โ€",0
161,The Top 10 Places In The World You're NOT Allowed To Visit,Dikran Arakelian (noreply@blogger.com),"Think the world is your oyster? Think again! From top secret HQ's to secretive underground train networks โ€“ we run through the Top 10 places you won't be entering anytime soon for love nor money. 10. Bohemian Grove Like something out of a cult thriller film, Bohemian Grove is a 2,700 acre rural location somewhere in Monte Rio, California. The land is owned by private San-Fran based arts club known โ€“ surprisingly โ€“ as the Bohemian Club. Every summer, the club host a two-week, three weekend camp in the woods for the most powerful men in the world. It all looks a bit weird. 9. Vatican Secret Archive This isn't just any old library, this is a Vatican library! Only a sacred few have access to the vaults โ€“ but feat not, if you need to read one of the books (which by the way are owned by the Pope) you can receive the manuscript via email โ€“ how very modern! 8. Lascaux Caves โ€“ France Found in South West France, Lascaux is complex of caves that are world-renowned for its Palaeolithic cave paintings that are estimated to be over 17,500 years old. Although these caves were once open to the public, they have since been closed to preserve the original artwork. 7. Pine Gap โ€“ Australia Known as Australia's equivalent of Area 51. Located in central Australia, and run the by the government and the CIA, it's the only place in the land down under designated as a no fly zone and is used as a monitoring station. What they're monitoring, we don't know. But according to recent news, Pine Gap operate a number of drone strike programmes. 6. Moscow Metro-2 Metro-2 is a secret underground tube system which runs parallel with the public metro system in Moscow. The system was built during the reign of Stalin and was code-named, D-6 by the Russian intelligence organisation โ€“ the KGB. When quizzed on this secret underground system, the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) would not confirm or deny its existence. It's rumoured that the underground system dwarfs the public Metro with 4 lines that run between 50-200m deep allowing the Kremlin to connect directly with FSB HQ, the government airport and an underground town at Ramenki. 5. Room 39 North Korea Based in North Korea, Room 39, also known as Bureau 39 is a secretive organisation thats sole purpose is to find ways to obtain foreign currency for Kim Jong-un. Established in 1970, the organisation has been described as the kingpin of North Korea's so-called, โ€court economyโ€. Although very little has been published on Room 39, it's believed that the organisation has over 20 bank accounts in Switzerland and China and are used solely for the purpose of money laundering and other illegal transactions. It has also been reported that the organisation is involved in drug smuggling and illicit weapon sales. What is known, is that the secretive group have over 130 trading companies under its jurisdiction which are controlled by Kim Jong-un. If you ever fancy popping over to North Korean and attempting to enter the organisations HQ, you need to head towards the Workers Party building in Pyongyang. 4. Mezghorye, Russia This place has been reported as Russia's secret nuclear missile site. There are two battalions permanently stationed here to ward off visitors. The base contains automatic ballistic missiles which can be remotely activated in the event of a nuclear strike which is detected by seismic, light and pressure sensors. 3. Disney Club 33 Exclusive Club Located at Disneyland, Florida, this fairly unobtrusive looking front door is actually the entrance to a highly exclusive members only club. How do I get in? I hear you cry. Well firstly, you need to locate it. Without giving too much away, head to New Orleans Square and look for the Blue Bayou. Getting in won't be as easy โ€“ the club is not open to the public. However, members, which include Presidents of the United States, business leaders and actors โ€“ can bring friends and associates along, so you better start networking! 2. Area 51 Probably the worst kept secret, Area 51 is the alias for a military base that is located in Nevada โ€“ around 80 miles north-west of downtown Las Vegas. In the centre of the base is a large military airfield. According to insiders, the base's main purpose is research and development of experimental aircrafts and weaponry. What's bizarre is that the U.S Government doesn't acknowledge it's existence โ€“ adding fuel to conspiracy theories that the base is used for analysis of UFO's and aliens or is that what they want you to think? 1.

164,A Black Church Was Just Burned And Spray-Painted โ€Vote Trumpโ€,Colin Taylor,"Comments 
Tensions are mounting as the most viciously divisive election in our nationโ€s history draws closer, and it is truly bringing out the worst in the American people. An African-American church in Mississippi, the Hopewell M.B. Church in Greeneville , has been set ablaze, causing heavy damage to the building โ€“ and in case there was any mystery as to who was responsible, โ€VOTE TRUMPโ€ was spray-painted on the side. 
For all their talk about โ€religious freedom,โ€ conservative Trump fans sure does have a fondness for attacking religious institutions. Mosques have been torched around the country in response to terrorist attacks , collectively punishing members of an entire religion for crimes committed by mentally disturbed individuals. 
Black churches have also been torched throughout the South as white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out of the wood-work, emboldened by Trumpโ€s racial dogwhistles and ethno-nationalist rabble-rousing. The worst of these targeted attacks came last summer when a white supremacist walked into the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C, and murdered nine peaceful worshippers. 
This is the second act of domestic terrorism committed in the United States today, coming just hours before a white man murdered two police officers in Iowa, and as Trump continues to rile up his base and perpetuate the delusions of a conspiracy against him, itโ€s not likely to be the last.",1
165,Sears Agrees to Sell Craftsman to Stanley Black &amp Decker to Raise Cash - The New York Times,Michael J. de la Merced,"The question from the analyst on Thursday was delicate enough. In agreeing to buy the Craftsman tool brand from Sears Holdings, how would Stanley Black  Decker protect itself from legal issues that could arise at the seller down the line? But the response from Stanley Black  Deckerโ€s chief executive, James M. Loree, acknowledged a concern that many on the conference call were likely to have harbored: that Sears could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection someday. โ€We expect to get this approved before there is any indication whatsoever that there would be any restructuring of that nature from Sears,โ€ Mr. Loree said, adding that he believed such a move was not imminent. The sale of Craftsman, valued at more than $775 million, was meant to prevent that day of reckoning by raising   cash for Sears. For Sears, selling one of its classic brands  โ€”   one it created nearly a century ago  โ€”   is the latest move to bolster its balance sheet during a prolonged sales slump. Edward S. Lampert, the chairman and chief executive of Sears, has struggled for years to find  ways to help the company, as much through esoteric financial maneuvers as through operational fixes. These have been tough times for retailers. Macyโ€s and Kohlโ€s said this week that their holiday sales were weaker than expected. Macyโ€s also announced plans to cut more than 10, 000 jobs and close 100 stores. Sears also suffered during the season, with   sales at its Sears and Kmart units down at least 12 percent. Sears has been in trouble far longer. Under Mr. Lampert, who is also a hedge fund manager, Sears has consistently lagged behind its peers, as analysts said, pointing to underinvestment in stores and slumping sales. Last September, analysts at Moodyโ€s estimated that the companyโ€s negative cash flow for its 2016 fiscal year would be $1. 5 billion. As of Oct. 29, Sears had $258 million in cash and equivalents on hand, compared with $3. 1 billion in   debt, the company said. Its market value Thursday morning, by comparison, was $1. 2 billion, even with a jump in its stock price after the Craftsman news. Sears shares surged as much as 8 percent on Thursday, before ending up 0. 3 percent on a day when some retail stocks tumbled. Sears has long been dogged by predictions that it would eventually be forced into bankruptcy. But on Thursday, the company listed its latest initiatives for shoring up its cash position, including closing 150 more stores and raising up to $1 billion through a $500 million loan backed by its real estate and a previously announced loan from Mr. Lampertโ€s hedge fund. โ€We are taking strong, decisive actions today to stabilize the company and improve our financial flexibility in what remains a challenging retail environment,โ€ Mr. Lampert, the companyโ€s biggest shareholder, said in a statement. Stanley Black  Decker will be able to sell Craftsman tools in even more outlets. Today, only 10 percent of the product lineup is sold outside Sears stores. โ€Craftsman is a legendary American brand,โ€ Mr. Loree said in a statement. โ€This agreement represents a significant opportunity to grow the market. โ€ Reaching the deal took months, as Mr. Loree acknowledged on the analyst call. Last spring, Sears announced that it had hired the banks Citigroup and LionTree as advisers to explore the sale of some of its   brands, including Craftsman, DieHard and Kenmore, to raise money. Stanley Black  Decker was one of several dozens of companies approached during the summer about bidding on the tool business. But after the company and its bankers at Deutsche Bank spent time devising a potential takeover bid, Stanley Black  Decker turned its eyes toward buying Newell Brandsโ€ tool business, a deal announced in October. By late fall, however, Sears returned to ask if Stanley Black  Decker would reconsider a bid for Craftsman. Under the deal, Stanley Black  Decker will pay $525 million when the transaction closes, which is expected to occur by   and an additional $250 million at the end of the third year after closing. Sears will also collect a percentage of new Craftsman sales for 15 years after the deal closes. The transaction is now valued at $900 million. โ€We literally spent months putting this transaction together and to cover each otherโ€s needs and manage the risk profile for both parties,โ€ Mr. Loree told analysts.",0
166,Takata Chief Executive to Resign as Financial Pressure Mounts - The New York Times,Jonathan Soble,"TOKYO  โ€”   The chief executive of Takata said on Tuesday that he would step down, as the embattled car parts supplier looks to attract   financial support to deal with the fallout from the largest automotive safety recall in history. The decision by the chief executive, Shigehisa Takada, reflects the financial pressure on Takata, which lost nearly $130 million last year. The company is in danger of buckling under the cost of the recall without a lifeline. His departure is the inevitable price of a cash infusion from new investors, who would most likely want a clean management slate. And any financial rescue would most likely mean shrinking the influence of the Takada family, which founded company in the 1930s and remains the largest shareholder. The resignation of Mr. Takada, the grandson of the founder, has been assumed for a while but never publicly discussed. In the more than two years after Takata was engulfed in a crisis over dangerously defective airbags, automakers have recalled 60 million vehicles in the United States and tens of millions more worldwide to fix the problem. The faulty equipment has been linked to 14 deaths and more than 100 injuries. Mr. Takada has been criticized for his leadership during the crisis. He has stayed largely in the background as the companyโ€s reputation and cash reserves have plummeted, leaving it to subordinates to explain Takataโ€s response to regulators, politicians and the news media. The company did not make any public statements until nearly a year after the defect came to light. Mr. Takada did not say when he would resign or what role, if any, he would retain inside the company, which is publicly traded but has been controlled by his family for more than 80 years. โ€I donโ€t intend to hold on to my position,โ€ he said at the companyโ€s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday. โ€Once Iโ€ve delivered this company to a place where itโ€s not at risk of faltering, I want to pass the baton. โ€ Mr. Takada has rarely addressed the crisis in public, but shareholder meetings, where investors can grill executives on a range of issues, have been an unavoidable exception. At Takataโ€s annual meeting last year, Mr. Takada apologized to victims but defended his companyโ€s airbags as fundamentally safe. The meeting on Tuesday was the first time Mr. Takada had said publicly that he would resign. Takata has been seeking emergency capital to keep it from falling into bankruptcy because of mounting recall costs. Once a rescuer is found, the company will probably be drastically restructured, including changes in its top management. โ€Nobody wants to see anybody from the Takada family in charge at this point,โ€ said Koji Endo, an auto industry analyst at Advanced Research Japan. โ€The Takada family, practically speaking, is being kicked out. โ€ Until 2014, Mr. Takada served in a more ceremonial role as Takataโ€s chairman. But he took over responsibility for    operations that year as the companyโ€s problems escalated, and its board named him to succeed a Swiss executive, Stefan Stocker, who was then its president. Few seem to believe that Takata can weather the recall crisis on its own. The company lost 13 billion yen last year, or about $127 million, and had just ยฅ54 billion in cash reserves as of the end of March, against recall costs that specialists say may ultimately exceed ยฅ1 trillion. A committee of lawyers and other   advisers appointed by the company this year said it risked bankruptcy if it did not find a rescue, and last month Takata hired the American investment bank Lazard to lead the search. Takata and its bankers have held discussions with a range of potential white knights, according to news reports, including the American buyout fund KKR  Company, formerly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and a Chinese car parts maker, Ningbo Joyson. Japanese automakers and banks, as well as the Japanese government, are also seen as potential contributors to a bailout. The most crucial question for Takata, specialists say, is how much of the recall costs will ultimately be borne by its automaker customers, rather than by the company itself. Fourteen carmakers have been affected by the airbag problem, in which the devicesโ€ inflaters can explode with too much force, sending shrapnel flying into a vehicleโ€s cabin. The latest deadly incident, a crash on Saturday in Malaysia that killed a    woman, involved a 2005 Honda City. The model had been recalled, but the vehicle had not been taken in to have the airbag component replaced, according to a spokesman for Honda Motor. In the most recent report on the airbag problem last month, safety regulators in the United States said prolonged exposure to environmental moisture and wide temperature fluctuations could degrade the propellant that Takata used in its inflaters, making it unstable and prone to unexpectedly exploding. Based on the finding, which was consistent with theories put forward by engineers and other specialists, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ordered Takata to work with automakers to recall an additional 35 million to 40 million airbags, bringing the number recalled in the United States to nearly 64 million. Carmakers have paid most of the bills for repairing defective airbags so far. They can try to recoup costs from Takata, but the amount is negotiable and subject to complicated calculations. Forcing Takata to repay the full cost would almost certainly bankrupt the company, depriving carmakers of a supplier that, for all its problems, is crucial to keeping their assembly lines running. Takata is one of just three major airbag manufacturers worldwide and controls 25 percent to 30 percent of the market, according to industry researchers. And cost sharing is vital to finding a savior for Takata: The more the recall costs are absorbed by carmakers, the more attractive Takata will look to potential investors. The intricate negotiations over cost sharing, which involve Takata, carmakers, potential investors and Japanese banks that have lent Takata money, are expected to take months. โ€Thereโ€s KKR, other funds, companies from China, Japan, American, maybe India  โ€”   20 or 30 companies are interested,โ€ Mr. Endo said. โ€It all depends on the cost split. Weโ€re likely to see a very complex structure that limits any one partyโ€s responsibility. โ€",0
167,"Goodbye, for Good, to Black Sabbath - The New York Times",Christopher D. Shea,"BIRMINGHAM, England  โ€”   On Saturday night at the Genting Arena here, a billowing white curtain whipped up and into the ceiling to reveal the singer Ozzy Osbourne, who, for perhaps the last time ever as the frontman of Black Sabbath, plunged into the 1970 song that gave the band its name. The track kicked off the final concert on a tour called โ€The End,โ€ which the   band has billed as its last performances. After 49 years, the group  โ€”   which formed here in 1968 and has had dramatic ups and downs and a rotating roster of members  โ€”   finally threw in the towel with a hometown concert. โ€Letโ€s go crazy,โ€ Mr. Osbourne yelled to the crowd, adding an expletive early in the concert, before turning in thrashing renditions of the bandโ€s   songs, including โ€War Pigs,โ€ โ€Into the Voidโ€ and โ€Iron Man,โ€ and deeper cuts like the instrumental โ€Rat Salad. โ€ Fans and members of the news media were buzzing before the concert with rumors of possible antics and surprises  โ€”   perhaps even an appearance by the original drummer, Bill Ward, estranged from the group since 2012. But Black Sabbath played it straight, turning in almost two hours of its earliest 1960s and โ€70s songs, pretty much unadulterated (but, of course, quite loud). Flanked by the original band members Tony Iommi (on guitar) and Geezer Butler (on bass) and backed by Tommy Clufetos, a younger drummer who rejoined them for the tour, Mr. Osbourne stood center stage and clutched the microphone, undulating back and forth as he sang. There were pyrotechnics for the big numbers, confetti at the end, and at one point a surprise volley of fireworks onstage. Giant black and purple balloons spilled from the ceiling in the penultimate song, and bounced around the arena for the rest of the night. Nearly a   ago, Black Sabbath began as a blues band. It quickly morphed into its own genre. In the bandโ€s early years, its   anthems and vague overtures toward Satanism in its lyrics earned them ridicule from mainstream critics and audiences while mobilizing a growing underground fan base. Mr. Osbourne gained a reputation as a forbidding figure who embraced hard living, and gained notoriety for biting off the head of a real bat during a 1982 concert. But Mr. Osbourneโ€s fame underwent a surprising shift when he began starring in the 2002 MTV reality TV show โ€The Osbournes,โ€ which portrayed him as a lovable, murmuring goofball and family man. And at its closing concert, Black Sabbath seemed pretty mainstream. On Saturday, the crowd was dotted with   fans decked out in    Black Sabbath regalia. But most concertgoers wore their fandom more lightly: One man in a Black Sabbath shirt who declined to give his name said that he worked in financial services in London and read an issue of The Economist in the moments before the lights went down. By the time Mr. Osbourne hit the climax of โ€Black Sabbath,โ€ the magazine was tucked away and the man was on his feet with his hands raised in the shape of devilโ€s horns, singing gleefully along to the lyrics: โ€Satanโ€s sitting there, heโ€s   those flames get higher and higher. โ€ The band has always identified as rough and tumble, alternative, working class and distinctly Birminghamian, so the hometown concert had special resonance for some in the audience on Saturday. โ€Black Sabbath are part of the cultural identity of being in Birmingham,โ€ said Pamela Pinski, 31, who lives and works in the area. Coming to the concert, she added, felt โ€kind of patriotic to the city,โ€ and like a chance to celebrate โ€local boys that done good. โ€ In interviews, the band members have insisted that โ€The Endโ€  โ€”   which began in Omaha just over a year ago and made stops in Europe, South America and Australia before coming to Britain last month  โ€”   really is their last run. Mr. Iommi, who learned he had cancer several years ago, told Rolling Stone that his โ€body wonโ€t take it much more. โ€ And Mr. Osbourne said in a recent interview with the BBC, โ€This is definitely it. โ€ Mr. Osbourne has said goodbyes to music before, though, so you could forgive fans for not taking him entirely at his word: In 1992, he went on a farewell tour that he billed as his swan song. Three years later, he was on the road again. Outside the arena, Errol Lynch, 45, was one of several fans who said he thought the band had more in store. โ€Two years down the line, theyโ€ll say, โ€Letโ€s put our problem behind us,โ€โ€ he said, adding that even if the band wouldnโ€t tour again, โ€they will do an odd festival. โ€ Mr. Lynch, originally from Ireland, was in Birmingham to see the group for the third time in the space of a week. (Mr. Osbourne, who has performed with other bands and as a solo act, and who was estranged from Black Sabbath through much of the 1980s and โ€90s, has at least one solo date planned for this summer, in Illinois.) Mr. Osbourne had said that he was feeling emotional in the   to Saturdayโ€s concert, but he gave only a fleeting farewell speech, marveling at โ€what a journey weโ€ve all had. โ€ Several times throughout the night he thanked the audience, and at one point he got down on his knees and bowed. When the last song, โ€Paranoid,โ€ ended, he blew a kiss, took some final bows, then stopped to have his picture taken with his bandmates before loping off the stage. In the arena lobby after the concert, Mike King, 32, who had traveled from San Francisco, said that he ranked the show among Black Sabbathโ€s better recent performances. โ€Iโ€m really, really, really going to miss them,โ€ he said, adding, โ€Once theyโ€re gone, thatโ€s it. โ€",0
168,Teen โ€Geisha Dollsโ€ Gang Busted for Armed Robberies - Breitbart,Adelle Nazarian,"Police in San Jose arrested a teenage trio that had terrorized and robbed over a dozen minimarts and gas stations at gunpoint or knifepoint over three months while wearing Geisha masks. [According to the San Jose Mercury News, the group known as the โ€Geisha Dollsโ€ crew targeted businesses in San Jose and Milpitas, and in some cases   the store workers, between Oct. 23 and Jan. 25.  They were given the name because their masks resemble the white powder makeup that Japanese geishas traditionally applied to their faces. The group consists of three teenagers. Two are 17 and one is 16. Authorities have reportedly withheld their names because they are minors. According to NBC Bay Area, a break in the case arrived on January 25 when โ€police arrested a juvenile suspect in connection to a robbery at the Arco   located at 2104 N Capitol Ave. Officers searched his residence and found evidence of the Arco   robbery. โ€ Nearly three weeks later, on Feb. 14, members of the Metro Unit reportedly located arrested a    and a    juvenile in San Jose .

This piece is very personal because, as an Indigenous woman, my analysis is very personal, as is the analysis that my friends on the frontlines have shared with me. We obviously canโ€t speak for everyone involved, as Native beliefs and perspectives are as diverse as the convictions of any people. But as my friends hold strong on the frontlines of Standing Rock, and I watch transfixed with both pride and worry, we feel the need to say a few things. 
Iโ€ve been in and out of communication with my friends at Standing Rock all day. As you might imagine, as much as they donโ€t want me to worry, itโ€s pretty hard for them to stay in touch. I asked if there was anything they wanted me to convey on social media, as most of them are maintaining a very limited presence on such platforms. The following is my best effort to summarize what they had to say, and to chime in with a few corresponding thoughts of my own. 
It is crucial that people recognize that Standing Rock is part of an ongoing struggle against colonial violence. #NoDAPL is a front of struggle in a long-erased war against Native peoples โ€” a war that has been active since first contact, and waged without interruption. Our efforts to survive the conditions of this anti-Native society have gone largely unnoticed because white supremacy is the law of the land, and because we, as Native people, have been pushed beyond the limits of public consciousness. 
The fact that we are more likely to be killed by law enforcement than any other group speaks to the fact that Native erasure is ubiquitous, both culturally and literally, but pushed from public view. Our struggles intersect with numerous others, but are perpetrated with different motives and intentions. Anti-Blackness, for example, is a performative enforcement of structural power, whereas the violence against us is a matter of pragmatism. The struggle at Standing Rock is an effort to prevent the construction of a deadly, destructive mechanism, created by greed-driven people with no regard for our lives. It has always been this way. We die, and have died, for the sake of expansion and white wealth, and for the maintenance of both. 
The harms committed against us have long been relegated to the history books. This erasure has occurred for the sake of both white supremacy and US mythology, such as American exceptionalism. It has also been perpetuated to sustain the comfort of those who benefit from harms committed against us. Our struggles have been kept both out of sight and out of mind โ€” easily forgotten by those who arenโ€t directly impacted. 
It should be clear to everyone that we are not simply here in those rare moments when others bear witness. 
To reiterate (what should be obvious): We are not simply here when you see us. 
We have always been here, fighting for our lives, surviving colonization, and that reality is rarely acknowledged. Even people who believe in freedom frequently overlook our issues, as well as the intersections of their issues with our own. It matters that more of the world is bearing witness in this historic moment, but we feel the need to point out that the dialogue around #NoDAPL has become extremely climate oriented. Yes, there is an undeniable connectivity between this front of struggle and the larger fight to combat climate change. We fully recognize that all of humanity is at risk of extinction, whether they realize it or not. But intersectionality does not mean focusing exclusively on the intersections of our respective work. 
It sometimes means taking a journey well outside the bounds of those intersections. 
In discussing #NoDAPL, too few people have started from a place of naming that we have a right to defend our water and our lives, simply because we have a natural right to defend ourselves and our communities. When โ€climate justiceโ€, in a very broad sense, becomes the center of conversation, our fronts of struggle are often reduced to a staging ground for the messaging of NGOs. 
This is happening far too frequently in public discussion of #NoDAPL. 
Yes, everyone should be talking about climate change, but you should also be talking about the fact that Native communities deserve to survive, because our lives are worth defending in their own right โ€” not simply because โ€this affects us all.โ€ 
So when you talk about Standing Rock, please begin by acknowledging that this pipeline was redirected from an area where it was most likely to impact white people. And please remind people that our people are struggling to survive the violence of colonization on many fronts, and that people shouldnโ€t simply engage with or retweet such stories when they see a concrete connection to their own issues โ€” or a jumping off point to discuss their own issues. Our friends, allies and accomplices should be fighting alongside us because they value our humanity and right to live, in addition to whatever else they believe in. 
Every Native at Standing Rock โ€” every Native on this continent โ€” has survived the genocide of a hundred million of our people. That means that every Indigenous child born is a victory against colonialism, but we are all born into a fight for our very existence. We need that to be named and centered, which is a courtesy we are rarely afforded. 
This message is not a condemnation. Itโ€s an ask. 
We are asking that you help ensure that dialogue around this issue begins with and centers a discussion of anti-Native violence and policies, no matter what other connections you might ultimately make, because those discussions simply donโ€t happen in this country. There obviously arenโ€t enough people talking about climate change, but there are even fewer people โ€” and letโ€s be real, far fewer people โ€” discussing the various forms of violence we are up against, and acting in solidarity with us. And while such discussions have always been deserved, we are living in a moment when Native water protectors and water warriors have more than earned both acknowledgement and solidarity. 
So if you have been with us in this fight, we appreciate you. But we are reaching out, right now, in these brave days for our people, and asking that you keep the aforementioned truths front and center as you discuss this effort. This moment is, first and foremost, about Native liberation, self determination and Native survival. That needs to be centered and celebrated. 
Thanks, 
K and friends

174,Sports Writer: NFL Great Jim Brownโ€s Decades of Civil Rights Work is Erased for Saying Nice Things About Donald Trump - Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,"As an example of just how much the left hates Donald J. Trump, after becoming enraged because football great Jim Brown expressed kind words for Trump, a writer for SportingNews. com decided that Brownโ€s decades of work for civil rights was erased merely because the Hall of Famer was nice to Trump. [SportingNews writer David Steele began his January 18 piece noting that the Cleveland Browns star has been a candidate for the โ€Mount Rushmore of social, political and   activism. โ€  โ€If Jim Brown is not on the Mount Rushmore of social, political and   activism by athletes in our time (up there with, at least, Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos) heโ€s on the short list waiting for a vacancy,โ€ Steele wrote. But that adulation came to an abrupt end. โ€He was, that is,โ€ Steele continued. โ€Jim Brown himself is now the vacancy. โ€ How could a man who spent nearly 50 years at the forefront of the civil rights movement be toppled from that place with just one action? He said nice things about Donald Trump. โ€Those are the consequences when you insert yourself into a feud between John Lewis and Donald Trump  โ€”   and take the side of Trump while insulting Lewis,โ€ Steele proclaimed. Steele, who once wrote for the Baltimore Sun, went on to โ€explainโ€ his โ€reasonsโ€ for erasing 50 years of civil rights advocacy work, โ€There is simply no way to reconcile Brownโ€s words, and all the others he has spouted in defense of the man who has spent the week insulting an icon of the movement, and this image, of the meeting Brown himself adjourned on behalf of Ali 50 years ago, when the same forces Lewis was fighting were coming after Aliโ€s resistance to the draft. โ€ So, because Jim Brown said a few nice things about Donald Trump and opposed the hateful attacks Congressman John Lewis launched against Trump, including the outright lie that he never missed a past inaugural when he in fact skipped George W. Bushโ€s for the same โ€heโ€s illegitimateโ€ reason, Brownโ€s decades of good work has become meaningless. Brown has done a lot for his community, and was universally praised by civil rights activists for organizing sports figures to come to the aide of boxing great Muhammad Ali when his title was stripped from him for refusing service in the Vietnam War in 1967. The NFL great also founded the Black Economic Union to help promote   business in the nationโ€s inner cities. But his founding of the    Foundation has done the most good, after he spent years trying to mitigate the   gang culture. โ€I was doing economic development for minorities. I was getting black folks to use their dollars to help each other. I looked up and saw black men killing each other over red and blue. Until we did something about that, there was no use for economic development,โ€ Brown recently told the New York Daily News. Since its founding nearly 25 years ago,    has improved the lives of gang members, prison inmates,     kids and thousands of other people in more than a dozen states across the nation. The heart of    is a   course Brown created which helps train young blacks to gain control of their emotions in order to lead useful, productive lives. The program he developed helps   youth learn to keep a job, raise a family, and go back to school. But to David Steele, all that is meaningless. โ€That Jim Brown is dead,โ€ Steele says at the tail of his hyperventilating and biased attack on Brown. In the end, though, one might doubt that a man who has 60 years of fame and achievement under his belt will be much bothered by the words of a man with a failed newspaper career and who now writes for a sports website.

175,Spider-pig Found in Amazon Rain Forest,nan,"Sunday, 30 October 2016 Spider-pig fever hits hard 
Little did Homer Simpson know when he sang his Spider-Man based song, he was actually describing an existing species. Just the sort of genius he is known for. 
Homer sang these prophetic words while holding a pig upside down, walking it along the ceiling: 
""Spider Pig! Spider Pig! Does whatever a spider pig does!Can he swing from a web? No, he can't. He's a pig."" 
An expedition in the deep Amazon rain forest found an actual spider-pig. It's about 1 ยฝ feet long, has eight legs, and has retractable sticky, suction cup-like extensions on its hooves. 
When walking on the forest floor spider-pig uses four legs at a time. It uses all 8 legs when climbing. 
Spider-pig can climb trees and spin a web but is too big to sit in it. And the pig doesn't want to eat what's caught in the web anyways. Scientists believe it just catches things for entertainment. 
Several cities currently compete to bring the first spider-pig to their local zoo including Springfield, Vermont; Springfield, Illinois; and Springfield, Oregon. Make pinkwalrus's  ",1
176,โ€I Can Watch It on TVโ€: Excuses for Republicans Skipping a Donald Trump Convention - The New York Times,Jeremy W. Peters,"A wave of prominent Republicans have announced their intention to skip the partyโ€s national convention in Cleveland this summer, the latest sign that Donald J. Trump, who last week secured the delegates needed to clinch the Republican presidential nomination, continues to struggle in his effort to unite the party behind his candidacy. The list of those who have sent regrets includes governors and United States senators  โ€”   almost all facing tough   fights this year  โ€”   and lifelong party devotees who have attended every convention for decades. Some are renouncing their seats like conscientious objectors. โ€I could not in good conscience attend a coronation and celebration of Donald Trump,โ€ wrote one Indiana delegate, Josh Claybourn, in a blog post resigning his position. The coolness toward Mr. Trump amounts to a remarkable rebuke. A broad range of party leaders are openly rejecting the man who will be their nominee. And the July   convention, usually a moment of public catharsis for political parties after contentious primaries, is shaping up to be another reminder of the disarray and disunity that is still rocking the Republican Party after a bitter   fight for the nomination. Even the two   Republicans in the conventionโ€s host state of Ohio  โ€”   Gov. John Kasich and Senator Rob Portman, who is fighting to hold onto his seat  โ€”   say they do not know if they will set foot in the convention hall. Mr. Kasich, who only four weeks ago quit the presidential campaign  and has not endorsed Mr. Trump, has no idea โ€what role if any he will have,โ€ a spokesman said. He will be in Cleveland that week but has no plans, as of now, to partake in any official convention activities. Several other of Mr. Trumpโ€s former rivals for the nomination have said they will not attend or have not committed. Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, will not be there. Neither will Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. โ€Iโ€m sure it will be fun, Iโ€m sure it will be entertaining,โ€ Mr. Graham said last week. โ€And I can watch it on TV. โ€ Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, who is a delegate as well as a former presidential candidate, has yet to decide. โ€T. B. D. ,โ€ a spokesman said. โ€The schedule is still being firmed up. โ€ At least two former competitors of Mr. Trumpโ€s are expected to attend: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who last week offered his services as a speaker should they be wanted. Among those staying away include some major corporations like   Microsoft and  . And some who do plan to be there might find the atmosphere somewhat uncomfortable. Mr. Trump has still not fully reconciled with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the conventionโ€s chairman, who said in early May that he was not ready to support the nominee and would relinquish the role if asked. Mr. Trump is also at odds with the head of the Republican Governors Association, Susana Martinez of New Mexico, who will lead her stateโ€s delegation in Cleveland. Ms. Martinez has also withheld her endorsement, a slight that evidently prompted Mr. Trump to attack her performance in office last week. Scheduling conflicts seem to be a surprisingly common excuse for missing an event that was announced a year and a half ago. Others offered mushy noncommitments. โ€Just as theyโ€re firming up the schedule, it kind of looks like thereโ€s a lot of stuff for me to do,โ€ said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, explaining why he probably couldnโ€t make it. Asked if Mr. Trump had anything to do with his reluctance, Mr. Johnson, who is in a heated   campaign, broke into a big smile and said, โ€Oh, of course not. โ€ Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, a state Mr. Trump has said he believes the Republicans can wrest from Democrats this year, also might have more important things to do at home. โ€Michigan has some pressing challenges right now,โ€ a spokeswoman said last week, โ€and state issues are his foremost priority. โ€ Mr. Snyder is one of at least nine Republican governors who are noncommittal or skipping the convention: Mr. Kasich, Brian Sandoval of Nevada, Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Bruce Rauner of Illinois, Larry Hogan of Maryland, Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina, Matt Mead of Wyoming and Nathan Deal of Georgia. โ€I donโ€t even want to be involved,โ€ Mr. Hogan said in an interview in March. โ€Itโ€s a mess. I hate the whole thing. โ€ Just about every Republican senator in a difficult race is staying away, fearful of what the association with Mr. Trump might do to reputations back home. Senator John McCain of Arizona will join four of the five living former Republican nominees in skipping the convention. โ€Iโ€m in a very tough   campaign,โ€ he said last week, explaining his expected absence. Senators Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois, two of the most endangered Republican incumbents, will also be nowhere near Cleveland that week. Mr. Portman, another senator in a tight race, said his time would be better spent holding a miniconvention of his own in Cleveland, which he plans to do with events for veterans, the homeless and his volunteers. โ€Iโ€ve spoken at every convention since 1996,โ€ he said. โ€Nobody listens, nobody covers it. โ€ This mass avoidance might seem, on its surface, to be yet another example of party elites snubbing Mr. Trump in the kind of rejection that he would welcome as a professed political outsider. But it also reflects a deeper and more dangerous problem for him: Mr. Trumpโ€s popularity with Republicans remains uncomfortably low. The candidateโ€s own party generally delivers support in the 90 percent range. (Mitt Romney won 93 percent of his own party in 2012.) Mr. Trumpโ€s support among Republicans, according to the latest NBC   Street Journal Poll, was 86 percent. And the snubs keep coming from the upper echelons of the party and the rank and file. In New Hampshire, the former senator Judd Gregg was initially a delegate for Mr. Bush. But when Mr. Bush suspended his campaign, Mr. Gregg became unbound. He has instead opted to skip the convention, telling a local television station, โ€Donโ€t like large crowds. โ€ The Indiana delegate who renounced his place at the convention, Mr. Claybourn, would have been bound to vote for Mr. Trump on the first ballot, a step he said he simply could not stomach. โ€Donald J. Trump is the Republican Partyโ€s nominee,โ€ Mr. Claybourn said. โ€But he will not be my nominee, and I will not attend a convention celebrating his candidacy. โ€",0
177,This Open Letter To Trump Voters Just Told It โ€Like It Isโ€,Colin Taylor,"Comments 
As election day draws closer and closer, it becomes even harder to understand or tolerate Donald Trump supporters. It is conceptually difficult for many of us to understand how anyone could support Trump knowing all we know about him. But many people donโ€t know what we know, so hereโ€s a viral list that every Trump supporter needs to read before they vote on Tuesday, courtesy of some anonymous Facebook poster. 
So You Want Someone To โ€Tell It Like It Isโ€? OK, Here You Go. 1. You join a lying machine and call Hillary crooked. But you support a man who refuses to release his tax returns. You support a greedy, self serving, manipulative proven tax cheat. You support a crooked narcissistic psychopath who is worried his tax returns would reveal evidence of financial ties to Russian oligarchs and other dictators of the world. Just like we now know Putinโ€s puppets illegally paid millions to his crooked former campaign manager, maybe he has been getting paid too. A corrupt little man whose daughter vacations with Putinโ€s girlfriend. Making Russia great again? A con man who funneled millions of campaign money to his own companies and used campaign money to pay his family handsomely. Using his own words, a disgusting and corrupt man who surrounds himself with a disgusting corrupt people. 2. You say you love our veterans but support a man who believes POWs are not heroes because they were captured? A man who has shown he lacks emotional intelligence when he attacked families of a fallen war hero. A man whose company fired a veteran for being deployed to Afghanistan. A man who insults and derides our generals. 3. You think a soulless, heartless small man who mocked a disabled reporter will make a good president. A man whose first instinct after a tragedy is always self-aggrandizement, like after Orlando mass shooting & when Dwyane Wadeโ€s cousin Nykea Aldridge was killed. As 3,000 people were dying, this man bragged about how 9/11 attacks were good for him & bragged about how his building is now the tallest in Manhattan just hours after the attack. When the pound fell to a 30-year low following the vote to exit EU, he boasted about making money off British economic uncertainty. When the housing market collapsed in 2008 and millions of Americans lost their homes, he said โ€ I โ€sort of hopeโ€ real estate market tanks.โ€ Trump is always looking out for Trump. How do you believe a greedy, narcissistic man who fundamentally lacks empathy and compassion will be a good president? He is not even a good person. 4. You say youโ€re patriotic & love this country but you support a man who has so little understanding of the basic parameters of our constitutionโ€s limits & has zero respect for it, except the part he uses to incite violence. A careless small man who asked Russia to spy on our former Secretary of State. A man who trash talks our NATO allies and our president but lavishly praises brutal dictators like Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong Un, Muammar Gaddafi, Vladimir Putinโ€ฆetc 5. You support a small man who has been married three times and has admitted to infidelity in the past. A man who was accused of raping his wife & has a federal lawsuit accusing him of raping a 13-year-old girl during a party hosted by convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein. A man who comments about his daughters breasts and body. Then you turn around and bring up Bill Clintonโ€s history with women? I agree with you 100% Bill has a disgraceful history with women but no comparison to Trump who has said cringeworthy, disturbing things about women his whole life. May I remind you Bill is NOT running to be the next president. If you are saying oh, candidates spouses are fair game then you canโ€t ignore that he is married to a woman whose naked pictures are all over the internet. 6. You support a man whose business career is a very long list of bankruptcies, defaults and deceptions because he is good for our economy? A man who was born into wealth and built that wealth by scamming, stiffing and bullying ordinary working citizens of this great country. 7. Yes, Hillary is not perfect, then again no one is. You call her dishonest but support a narcissistic pathological liar? Every time Trump opens his mouth every other word that comes out is a lie. Fact checkers have proven it over and over again. We are talking about a man who makes things up to spew hate and fear, like when he lied about seeing an Iran ransom video and a video of muslims celebrating in New Jersey on 9/11. The man is incapable of telling the truth and he is delusional. 
8. You support a hypocritical man who hired undocumented immigrants for his real estate projects & exploited our visa program. He is a man capable of solving our immigration problem? 9. I agree 100% if sheโ€s elected Hillary and her whole family must distance themselves from the Clinton foundation. Let other people continue the great work the foundation is doing. With that said, you support a man whose foundation is found guilty of a pay-to-play scam and false claims of giving on its tax forms and then turn around and try to push fabricated scandals about the Clinton foundation. The IRS found the con man used funds from his charitable foundation to make a campaign donation to Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. Just after 4 days of the bribe payment Pam dropped Trump U case. He also held $150K fundraiser for Pam after she dropped a criminal case against his university. His foundation claimed on its tax return forms that it gave $10,000.00 to The Giving Back Fund, but the organization says that donation does not exist. A man who completely retooled his charity to spend other peopleโ€s money. A man with deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and criminals. 10. You claim the con man whose line of clothing and accessories are made in Bangladesh, China, Honduras and other low-wage countries is the man to fix our labor laws? You claim the man who outsources everything is the answer to creating jobs here at home? 11. You claim the unfit, unstable Putinโ€s little puppet whose campaign is fully embracing alt-rightโ€s anti-Muslim and anti-Immigrant ideologies with all their conspiracy theories is the one to unite the country? 12. You support a bottom feeder who put racial discrimination in housing at the heart of his real estate developments, started the birther movement, said โ€Obama would look perfect on food stamps, he has the right face for it,โ€ and has shown he is prejudice with his actions & words over and over again. Then he pretends he cares about the black communities. He brings up Hillaryโ€s reference to a group of violent repeat criminals as โ€super-predatorsโ€ in 1996? I donโ€t agree with her choice of words all those years ago but she has apologized since. Something Trump refuses to do. Of course you can use all kind of deflection tactics & tell yourself whatever makes you feel better but the reality is if you are supporting a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, bigoted, unfit, unqualified, disgusting con man, you really should admit to yourself you donโ€t care what he says or does. You are using your hatred to cloud your judgement.",1
178,Comment on This Powerful Corporate Lobby Is Quietly Backing Hillary โ€” and Nobodyโ€s Talking About It by runsinquicksand,runsinquicksand,"Carey Wedler | ANTIMEDIA 
Over the course of the 2016 presidential election, Americans who rail against Hillary Clinton have condemned the mediaโ€s bias in her favor โ€” and rightfully so. Clinton has effectively infiltrated the corporate news media โ€” whose parent companies often donate to her โ€” with the deliberate intent of bolstering her own chances at the presidency. 
But as this nefarious behavior continues to come to light through hacks and leaks, another powerful sphere of media influence has quietly placed its resources behind Hillary Clinton โ€“ and hardly anyone is talking about it. 
Though outrage over Clintonโ€s corporate sponsors usually focuses on her support from banking giants like Goldman Sachs , Citibank, JP Morgan, and other reviled companies, corporate Hollywood has collectively supplied her campaign with far more cash than these banks. 
When people think of Hollywoodโ€s support for a political campaign, their minds tend to focus on the entertainment industryโ€s most visible figures โ€” celebrities. From George Clooney , Katy Perry, and Leonardo DiCaprio to Justin Timberlake, Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg, Beyonce, and Jay-Z, the celebrity consensus this year has settled on Clinton. 
But underneath the starsโ€ โ€progressiveโ€ choice is an intentional, systematic machine working in Hillaryโ€s favor, and it mirrors other conglomerated industries that have aligned behind her. Moguls with Millions (and Billions) Back Hillary and the Clinton Family 
The first layer of Clintonโ€s corporate Hollywood allegiance is rather simple to peel back, simply because Hillaryโ€s top industry donors make no secret of their support. 
Earlier this year, George Clooney held a $100,000-a-plate fundraiser for Clinton, one that earned $15 million dollars โ€” far more than Goldman Sachs has collectively donated to her campaign. The actorโ€s event raised money for the Hillary Victory Fund, which was recently revealed to be an avenue for maxed out donors to contribute more than the allowable amount. The Victory Fund has also been criticized for hoarding money for Hillary that was supposed to go to state Democratic parties. 
Clooney teamed up with one of corporate Hollywoodโ€s most powerful executives, Jeffrey Katzenberg, for this fundraiser. Katzenberg rose to prominence at Walt Disney in the 1990s, where he helmed some of the millennial generationโ€s favorite childhood films: Beauty and the Beast , Aladdin , the Lion King , and the Little Mermaid were all products of Katzenbergโ€s leadership. 
Several years later, he partnered with Steven Spielberg (also a longtime Clinton supporter) and David Geffen, a music mogul, to create Dreamworks Animation. Katzenberg was the top bundler for Barack Obama in 2012 and also funded him in 2008, so itโ€s unsurprising the president takes his phone calls. Further, Katzenbergโ€s right-hand man, Andy Spahn, visited the White House almost 50 times during Obamaโ€s first term, Mother Jones reported at the time, enjoying a close relationship with the president โ€” and some economic benefits. 
Katzenberg, who recently earned $391 million on the sale of Dreamworks to Comcast, has donated at least $1 million to Clintonโ€s campaign this election season. 
Then thereโ€s billionaire Haim Saban, the staunchly pro-Israel entertainment mogul behind the original Power Rangers series. He is Clintonโ€s top individual donor, besting Katzenberg, with at least $6.4 million in donations to her campaign. He has contributed $15 million to the Clinton Foundation, and his wife, Cheryl, serves on the board. 
Saban has supported the Clintons since the 1990s, and during Billโ€s time in office, he enjoyed the business perks of being friends with the president of the United States, as Mother Jones has detailed . His investments are tied to Wall Street, and he has also enjoyed Clintonโ€s condemnation of Boycott, Sanction, Divest, a nonviolent, market-based global protest movement challenging Israelโ€s occupation of Palestine. 
Both men, therefore, know well the perks of having friends in high places โ€” and both are some of the top donors of any candidate in the 2016 race. But their very publicโ€” and lavish โ€” support barely scratches the surface of the real machinations taking place between Hollywoodโ€s corporate underbelly and its stake in American politics. The Studio Lobby 
Most people, if theyโ€ve heard of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) at all, know it as the organization that rates films. Itโ€s the familiar, almost comforting disclaimer that appears before a trailer or film, ranking it G, PG, PG-13, R, or in some cases, NC-17. 
Though the organization has its roots in the 20th century, founded as an effort to self-regulate their content, more than anything, it is corporate Hollywoodโ€s lobby. The MPAA represents 20th Century Fox (owned by Rupert Murdochโ€s News Corp.), Warner Brothers (owned by Time Warner), Disney, Universal (owned in part by Comcast), Sony Pictures, and Paramount Pictures (News Corp, Time Warner, and Comcast have all contributed to the Clinton Foundation). 
For some, itโ€s difficult to place corporate Hollywood in the same category as more reviled industries like banking, weapons manufacturing, or pharmaceuticals . This is likely, at least in part, because they deliver one of Americaโ€s favorite pastimes โ€” entertainment. Yet the revolving door is strong, as is the MPAAโ€s political foundation. 
In fact, the MPAAโ€s longest running chairman was Jack Valenti , who served as an advisor to Lyndon B. Johnson before taking over the lobbying group. By 2011, former senator and presidential candidate, Chris Dodd, had taken the reins. 
Dodd, who makes $3 million a year working as the organizationโ€s top lobbyist, takes his job seriously. As the Los Angeles Times reported , Dodd has increased lobbying funds and efforts in Congress. โ€ Weโ€ve had a hundred meetings with new members of Congress since November ,โ€ he told the publication last year. 
Dodd is a Clinton supporter. He officially endorsed her earlier this year. 
Disney chairman Bob Iger is also a huge Clinton supporter and member of the MPAA. Alongside Saban, Iger hosted a Hollywood fundraiser for her in August and held a meeting with Tim Kaine, Clintonโ€s running mate, in September. 
On that same trip, Kaine met with Warner Brothers executive Kevin Tsujihara, who donated to Hillary Clintonโ€s Victory Fund this year. He met with Fox Television executive Dana Walden, who also donated to Clinton. He also met with Kevin Reilly, an executive at Turner, which is owned by Time Warner, which owns Warner Brothers and CNN , an outlet condemned for heavily favoring Clinton this election cycle. Perhaps these private meetings were about gun control and equal rights. Or, perhaps, Kaine and the executives discussed business interests. 
Either way, the paper trail gets more decisive โ€” and more revealing. What is the MPAA Hoping to Achieve? 
MPAA members Disney and Sony have independently advocated for the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal , the globally loathed trade agreement criticized for granting carte blanche to corporations and stripping nations of their sovereignty. Disney has even prodded its employees to contribute lobbying funds in support of the agreement. Fox, Disney, Time Warner, Comcast, and other media companies have lobbied in favor of TPP . 
One of TPPโ€s most dangerous provisions is its intent to regulate copyright and intellectual property in favor of corporations โ€“ one of corporate Hollywoodโ€s main objectives. 
Dodd is, unsurprisingly, a proponent of internet censorship legislation, which corporate Hollywood invariably backs in its attempts to preserve its copyright profits. Hollywood studios have been some of the biggest proponents of heavy internet regulation (with regard to copyright) and have waged campaigns against online piracy. The MPAAโ€s website claims โ€the most serious threatโ€ to the film industry is online copyright theft. 
It makes sense, then, that the MPAA would be a member of the U.S. Business Coalition for TPP . This massive trade group spent $658 billion dollars on lobbying in 2014, according to Common Cause, a left-leaning nonprofit lobbying organization. The coalition includes members like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Dow Chemical , Pfizer , GlaxoSmithKline , Boeing , and Viacom (another media behemoth). Interestingly, the coalitionโ€s website no longer lists its members, though Anti-Media easily accessed an archived version of that information. 
These corporations, or their employees, have also donated funds to Hillary Clinton in one way or another, often via the Clinton Foundation, which has been documented to issue favors to entities that contribute funds. Dozens of media corporations have donated to the foundation. 
And โ€” surprise, surprise โ€” the only presidential candidate the MPAA has contributed to in 2016 is โ€ฆ Hillary Clinton. 
While itโ€s certainly the case that Hollywood executives lean liberal and many undoubtedly support Clinton due to a misguided moral imperative to stop Donald Trump, it would be naive to presume this is the only dynamic at play. 
This dynamic is evident in a letter from MPAA chief counsel Steven Fabrizio to Disneyโ€s Alan Braverman, among others, assuring them of his efforts to pass the bill. โ€ Finally, in regard to trade ,โ€ he wrote , โ€ the MPAA/MPA with the strong support of your studios, continue to advocate to governments around the world about the pressing need for strong pro-IP trade policies such as TPP and the proposed EU/US trade agreement (TTIP). โ€ 
Braverman donated to Clinton this year. Infiltrating the DNC Platform Drafting Committee 
Most damning is the fact that one MPAA lobbyist, former California congressman Howard Berman, ended up on the drafting committee for the Democratic platform this year (throughout the course of his political career, some of his top donors were Hollywood studios). 
According to an email released by Wikileaks, Berman met with now-disgraced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in May of this year โ€” two months before he helped draft the platform. She appointed him to the platform drafting committee. 
That platform was widely criticized for refusing to condemn and reject TPP outright, as Bernie Sanders and his camp attempted to do. Berman helped vote down language against TPP. 
โ€But Hillary opposes TPP!โ€ some might argue. Indeed, after claiming it was set to be the โ€gold standardโ€ of trade agreements, she changed her mind and said she opposed it. But a leak from the recently released John Podesta batch showed there is a very strong chance she will change her mind, again, once elected. And considering Donald Trumpโ€s anti-trade deal rhetoric against both NAFTA and TPP (not to mention his incendiary rhetoric), it makes little sense for corporate Hollywood to back Trump โ€” even if theyโ€re partly responsible for his meteoric rise via the Apprentice . 
In a vein similar to Bermanโ€s, a former MPAA (and Disney, and Dow, and Citigroup) lobbyist, Jose Villareal, now serves as the Clinton campaignโ€s treasurer. 
Though there is no smoking gun proving corporate Hollywood is backing Clinton with the express intent of ensuring passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, itโ€s telling that the MPAAโ€s homepage is a tribute to TPP (and, naturally, themselves). Itโ€s telling that the organization donated to only one presidential candidate. Itโ€s telling that executives within these corporations are supporting Clinton while the companies they represent heavily back TPP โ€” and in many cases, Clinton. Itโ€s telling that their parent corporations, like News Corp and Time Warner , are backing her โ€” and the TPP. 
Considering six corporations control 90% of media in the United States and Clinton continually proves her loyalties to big business, itโ€s hardly surprising sheโ€s the choice of corporate Hollywood. And itโ€s likely theyโ€ll expect favors in return. 
As Dodd said following President Obamaโ€s rejection of SOPA and PIPA following public outcry in 2012: 
โ€Candidly, those who count on quote โ€Hollywoodโ€ for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully whoโ€s going to stand up for them when their job is at stakeโ€ฆDonโ€t ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then donโ€t pay any attention to me when my job is at stake.โ€ Don't forget to follow the D.C.

180,Hijacking Ends Peacefully After Libyan Airliner Lands in Malta - The New York Times,Declan Walsh,"CAIRO  โ€”   When two Libyans hijacked a passenger jetliner on Friday and forced it to land in Malta, they claimed to be acting in the name of the countryโ€s former ruler, Col. Muammar  . They were ripping a page from history as they did it: During his 42 years in power, Colonel Qaddafi sponsored numerous acts of international airline terrorism, including hijackings and the bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie in 1988 that killed 270 people. Yet unlike most   airline dramas, this one was resolved easily. Within hours of landing in Malta, the two hijackers had released the other 115 people aboard and had surrendered peacefully to the Maltese authorities. Their weapons  โ€”   a pistol and a grenade  โ€”   turned out to be replicas. Libyan officials said the two men had asked for visas to Europe. But the hijacking, and its stated inspiration, did point to the enduring chaos of Libya, a country with three rival governments that, despite United   peace efforts, remains fragile and deeply unstable five years after Colonel Qaddafiโ€s death. After forcing the plane to land in Malta, one of the hijackers emerged with a flag in the green that symbolized Colonel Qaddafiโ€s rule, and claimed to have established a new political party honoring the autocrat. The episode started early Friday when an Airbus A320 operated by the Libyan state airline, Afriqiyah Airways, took off from the desert town of Sabha, heading north to the capital, Tripoli. Before it could land, the hijackers, whom officials identified as Subah Mussa and Ahmed Ali, seized control of the plane and diverted it to Malta, about 200 miles off the Libyan coast. They had initially demanded to be taken to Rome, but the pilot said there was only enough fuel to reach Malta. The hijackers threatened to detonate a grenade if their demands were not met. Aboard the plane were 109 passengers and six crew members. (Maltese officials initially said there was seven crew members.) The hijackers claimed to represent a new political party called Al Fateh Al Jadeed  โ€”   a reference to the 1969 military coup in Libya that brought Colonel Qaddafi to power. โ€We did this to announce and publicize our new party,โ€ one of the men said in a telephone interview with a Libyan news outlet. Libyan officials, though, believed the hijackers had more personal goals. A senior official with Afriqiyah, Capt. Abdelatif Ali Kablan, said they had demanded Schengen visas to travel in Europe. They did not seem to be linked to any of the radical Islamist groups, like Islamic State, that operate in Libya, he added. โ€We feared they might be some of those ideological people, but that seems not to be the case,โ€ Captain Kablan said by phone from Libya. Throughout the crisis, Maltaโ€s prime minister, Joseph Muscat, used Twitter to provide a running feed of information about the security operation, the orderly release of the passengers in batches of 25 and the eventual surrender of the two hijackers. In a news conference later, Mr. Muscat said his security forces had found a pistol and a grenade on the hijackers, and discovered a second pistol in a subsequent search of the airplane, raising questions about security standards in Libyan airports. Later, though, Mr. Muscat posted that the weapons were replicas. It was the second hijacking this year of a passenger jet in the Mediterranean region. In March, an Egyptian man commandeered a domestic EgyptAir flight en route to Cairo and forced it to land in Cyprus, where he demanded the release of political prisoners in Egypt and a meeting with his estranged wife. The crisis ended hours later with the surrender of the hijacker, Seif Eldin Mustafa, who turned out to be wearing a fake explosive vest fashioned from mobile phone cases that had been taped together. Some news outlets later nicknamed him the โ€lovejacker. โ€ In September, a court in Cyprus ordered the deportation of Mr. Mustafa to Egypt. His lawyers are resisting the order and seeking asylum for Mr. Mustafa, claiming that he could be tortured if sent home. As well as supporting the Pan Am bombing in 1988, Colonel Qaddafi was also linked to the bombing of a French aircraft over Niger in 1989 that left 170 dead and the hijacking of a Pan Am flight to New York from Karachi in 1986 by a Palestinian splinter group that ended with a deadly siege. Today, many senior officials from his government live in exile in Cairo, Tunis or Europe. There is no significant   movement inside Libya, although the dominant military commander in the east, Gen. Khalifa Hifter, has often been said to harbor strongman ambitions similar to those of Colonel Qaddafi. Many Libyans, though, say in private that they yearn for the order and prosperity of the Qaddafi era. Rival militias and political factions have carved the country into zones of influence, causing a sharp decline in the countryโ€s oil production and a severe economic crisis that has caused hardship for most Libyans.",0
181,You Donโ€t Like the Girls in โ€Girlsโ€? Thatโ€s Its Genius. - The New York Times,Wesley Morris,"Normally, youโ€d be confused. Why would HBO lower the curtain on Season 5 of โ€Girlsโ€ with two episodes on Sunday rather than the usual one at a time? Why not give the showโ€s 10 episodes a full 10 weeks? But there are the mysteries. Then there are the realities. And the presumable reality is that decks needed clearing and hatches needed battening for next weekendโ€s simultaneous resumption of โ€Game of Thrones,โ€ โ€Veepโ€ and โ€Silicon Valleyโ€  โ€”   and the Saturday unveiling of whatever this    Beyoncรฉ โ€Lemonadeโ€ thing is supposed to be. So Sundayโ€s   โ€Girlsโ€ finale points to the national indifference thatโ€s accrued around a show whose fealty to discomfort, poor choices and social cannibalism, which felt new in 2012, are now just part of televisionโ€s oxygen. In the last two seasons, the showโ€s senses of satire and pathos are stronger and more pungent than everBut itโ€s true: Funny narcissists are indeed easy to come by (even on HBO). Perhaps instead youโ€re watching โ€Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,โ€ โ€Veepโ€ โ€Transparent,โ€ โ€Togethernessโ€ โ€Crazy  โ€ and โ€Youโ€re the Worst. โ€ And โ€Girlsโ€ didnโ€t invent them. There they were, for instance, on โ€The Golden Girls,โ€ โ€Will  Grace,โ€ โ€Sex and the Cityโ€ and โ€30 Rock. โ€ But โ€Girlsโ€ keeps finding ways of dramatizing its satire so that it doesnโ€t always seem satirical. Few shows better explore the complications of personality and behavior. Even if it doesnโ€t appear as robust, refined and specific an achievement as, say, โ€Transparent,โ€ the show still has the confidence to jump along a tightrope of displeasure. [ Has โ€Girlsโ€ gotten better? Read our discussion. ] The showโ€s   ringmastered by its chief protagonist, Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham) pinball off one another, going from friends to lovers to frenemies. What set the show apart this year  โ€”   from both its previous seasons and most of its peers  โ€”   is the use of the space, place, framing, allusion and mood to house that narcissism. Bad manners are met with mannerism. Shoshannaโ€s first adult job landed her in Tokyo and, for a few episodes, the show went with her. Her intoxication with the culture  โ€”   without her Japanese pals losing sight of her foreignness  โ€”   felt like a gentle rebuke of the incurious insularity of a movie like โ€Lost in Translation. โ€ She wasnโ€t a citizen. Nor was she a tourist. This seasonโ€s seventh episode was particularly handsome. Written by Sarah Heyward and directed by Richard Shepard, it turned the 1964 murder of Kitty Genovese into a piece of immersive theater staged inside and around a stately apartment complex, which was meant to evoke the building near where Genovese was killed, while her neighbors went about their business. The killing inspired decades of   research the show used the case as an ideal test for the charactersโ€ own emotional nearsightedness. (โ€Hello Kittyโ€ is the episodeโ€s title.) Hannah enters the building lobby   with her current boyfriend, Fran (Jake Lacy) and leaves devastated that her ex, Adam (Adam Driver) might be sleeping with one of her best friends, Jessa (Jemima Kirke). As usual, the comedy comes, in part, from Hannahโ€s obnoxious rebellion against propriety, which tends to be represented by poor Ray (Alex Karpovsky). His morality, civic engagement, loyalty and earnestness (culturally, heโ€s a generation older) are constantly disrupted, compromised and exploited by everyone else. This time he just wants to lose himself in some theater and no one will let him. The small silences in this episode are rich and absorptive. Theyโ€re too much, though, for Hannah, who keeps breaking them to muse about the artifice of it all. When her friend Marnie (Allison Williams) enters one apartment, newly single and almost radioactively aglow, she doubles the obliviousness. Itโ€s unclear she even knows sheโ€s at a play. Theyโ€re there to see Adam perform as half of a squabbling married couple, but by the time the play reaches its grisly climax, none of these people are really paying attention. Adam looked across the courtyard at Jessa, whoโ€s vamping at him on a fire escape, while Hannah watches them both in disbelief. They ignore the screams and barely notice the amateurish plaster statues that stand in for the victim and her killer. Thereโ€s just Brenda Lee misting up the soundtrack. Basically, a   crime loses out to a figurative one. Itโ€s one of the showโ€s most sophisticated and most intricately filmed gags about selfishness. The camera glides toward windows. It cranes downs at the plaster  . It oscillates from Jessa to Adam to Hannah. Perhaps you think about โ€Rear Window,โ€ โ€Monsieur Hire,โ€ โ€Stakeoutโ€ or any other movie involving voyeurism, danger and a little melodrama. And the atmosphere is so rich you can practically feel the balm of warm spring air. But Hannah and Marnie peel off to commiserate. And by the time you see these two spread out on somebodyโ€s bed, theyโ€ve cast themselves in their own sitcom: โ€The Sorrow and the  . โ€ But the show manages to maintain the gravity of both transgressions: an ambitious if seemingly dumb take on real tragedy and the tragedy that Hannah thinks is her life. Itโ€s a kicky, poignant   of television  โ€”   half of which is spent elsewhere at a Manhattan party, featuring Hannahโ€s roommate, Elijah (Andrew Rannells) who is trying to hold his own among greasy gay celebrities. Each plot warranted its own episode, but that was โ€Girlsโ€ this year: so many good ideas, so little space to unfurl them. There were moments during the seriesโ€ underrated fourth season when, between Hannahโ€s damningly indulgent stint at the Iowa Writersโ€ Workshop and the invention of a carnivorous   named   (Gillian Jacobs) the show looked as if it had found its groove as a   farce. This fifth season ended on a   note, after Hannah runs into Tally (Jenny Slate) a college classmate, with a dark cloud of hair, who has become a literary star. Sheโ€s like Bizzaro Hannah: Her narcissism doesnโ€t repel success it vacuums it up. Tally encourages Hannah to steal a guyโ€s unlocked bike (itโ€s a sign, Tally says) and through two montages  โ€”   set first to Vanity Fare then to Nicki Minaj and Beyoncรฉ  โ€”   they take a ride, smoke a joint on Hannahโ€s bed, and dance in her apartment. And for half an episode, as Tally and Hannah pedal and puff, โ€Girlsโ€ is no longer โ€Girls. โ€ Itโ€s โ€Broad City. โ€ On that show, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson mount a perfectly calibrated celebration of millennial obnoxiousness, while also nailing the ridiculousness of   consumer culture. The two shows have unruly young women and Brooklyn in common. Thatโ€s about it. But the way Ms. Slate is made to look resembles  โ€”   passingly, cartoonishly  โ€”   Ms. Glazer. These scenes between Ms. Slate and Ms. Dunham suggest a lunatic road not taken. โ€Girlsโ€ has some great slapstick. But itโ€s bending toward maturity that โ€Broad Cityโ€ doesnโ€t care about. When it started, โ€Girlsโ€ was received as an anthem for entitled white women. Detractors had a field day with Ms. Dunham, who created this show and has written and directed much of it, for privileging privilege, as if she couldnโ€t be aspiring to the withering heights of Luis Buรฑuel or Carrie Fisher. Through 52 episodes of television  โ€”   some of them, like that Kitty Genovese episode, marvelous  โ€”   โ€Girlsโ€ has never stopped looking for the grander, harsher psychological picture. Itโ€s never stopped looking for tough laughs. It fights   American absurdity with its own version of it, as it does in the final episode of the season, in which Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet, a crayon turning at last into a scalpel) rebrands Rayโ€s coffee shop as a   haven for people who actually work  โ€”   that is, for โ€adults,โ€ in other words. But in its highest gear, the show peerlessly vanishes the line between sociocultural satire and mental instability, between send up and crack up. That business with Hannah, Adam and Jessa closes the season with an unnerving cliffhanger. Hannah performs her pain for the storytellersโ€ radio hour โ€The Moth,โ€ which obviously she takes to like a    to a flame. The nightโ€s theme is jealousy. In her tale, she proves sheโ€s overcome it by delivering a peace offering in the form of a fruit basket. But the story deepens and darkens a deranged argument that took place a few minutes earlier. Suddenly, Hannahโ€s narcissism seems terroristic. Her personality disorder has the power to disorder other peopleโ€s personalities. Maybe, sheโ€s the disorder. One of the last shots hovers about a demolished living room. But itโ€s not exactly a cliffhanger for the showโ€s next and final season. Itโ€s a   view of the wreckage in the canyon. Plus, thereโ€s something about the way the camera lingers on the basket outside the door that makes Hannahโ€s offering seem more than a gift. It looks like a bomb.",0
182,Scientists Say Canadian Bacteria Fossils May Be Earthโ€s Oldest - The New York Times,Carl Zimmer,"They are microscopic artwork: tiny tubes and long filaments, strange squiggles etched into some of the most ancient rocks known. On Wednesday, researchers reported that these may be the oldest fossils ever discovered, the remains of bacteria thriving on Earth not long, geologically speaking, after the very birth of the planet. If so, they offer evidence that life here got off to a very early start. But many experts in the field were skeptical of the new study  โ€”   or downright unconvinced. Martin J. Van Kranendonk, a geologist at the University of New South Wales, called the patterns in the rocks โ€dubiofossilsโ€  โ€”     structures, perhaps, but without clear proof that they started out as something alive. Heated disputes are nothing new in the search for the earliest life on Earth. In 1993 J. William Schopf, a paleontologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues found what that they, too, argued were the worldโ€s oldest fossils: chainlike blobs in 3. 46    rocks made, they said, by bacteria. Other researchers later argued that the structures were just oddly shaped minerals. But additional specimens from other sites came to light over the past two decades, and many of them have withstood scrutiny. There is now solid evidence of life dating back about 3. 5 billion years. Earth was a billion years old by then, and scientists have long wondered if even older fossils might be found. In August, Dr. Van Kranendonk and his colleagues reported discovering fossils in Greenland dating back 3. 7 billion years. The scientists argued that the organisms were once mats of bacteria that grew in shallow coastal waters. In the new study, published in the journal Nature, Mattew S. Dodd, Dominic Papineau and their colleagues at University College London studied rocks that were either slightly older or much older than those containing the Greenland fossils. They came from a remote geological formation in Canada called Nuvvuagittuq, which stretches across four square miles on the coast of Hudson Bay. Geologists surveyed the formation for the first time in the 1990s. Researchers have variously estimated its age at 3. 77 billion years or 4. 22 billion years  โ€”   just 340 million years after the formation of the planet. In 2008, Dr. Papineau collected rocks from the formation and found a number of clues indicating that they had formed around hydrothermal vents on the ancient sea floor that spewed iron and other minerals. He also found hints that there might have been life there  โ€”   tiny blobs of rock, for instance, that contained a compound called apatite, which can form from phosphorus released by dying organisms. The tubes and other structures in the rock that Mr. Dodd found are also reminiscent of bacteria that live today around hydrothermal vents. They grow as filaments, feeding on iron compounds and creating   cavities in the sediment. Similar filaments contain iron compounds in the Nuvvuagittuq rocks, Mr. Dodd and his colleagues found, and they are attached to round clumps that resemble the tiny anchors bacteria use to hold on to rock surfaces. The rocks also contain forms of organic carbon that could have been created by bacteria. The researchers argue that it would be unlikely for all of these features to have formed in the absence of life. โ€Then youโ€re left with one scenario  โ€”   a biological origin,โ€ Mr. Dodd said. Such a discovery could have big implications for the understanding of lifeโ€s early evolution. If these really are fossils 3. 77 billion years old, then they show that life was already diversifying by that time, thriving in both the shallow ocean in what is now Greenland and the deep ocean in todayโ€s Canada. And if these are fossils 4. 2 billion years old, then scientists will have evidence that life began quickly on Earth, not long after the oceans formed. Yet Frances Westall, the director of research at the   de Biophysique Molรฉculaire in Orlรฉans, France, isnโ€t convinced these are fossils at all. โ€I am frankly dubious,โ€ she said. For one thing, she has argued, the filaments in the Nuvvuagittuq rocks are too big. She and her colleagues have found filaments formed by bacteria in rock dating back 3. 3 billion years, and these are far smaller. On the early Earth, bacteria were forced to stay small, Dr. Westall said, because the atmosphere did not yet have enough oxygen to fuel their growth. Long after the Nuvvuagittuq rocks formed on the sea floor, they were heated to tremendous temperatures. Some experts doubted that microscopic fossils could have survived such a baking. โ€These authors built their research on pushing speculative ideas and appear totally unaware of the considerable evidence against their interpretation,โ€ said Wouter Bleeker, of the Geological Survey of Canada. In response, Dr. Papineau observed that the type of rock studied, known as chert, is very hard and might have protected fossils from high temperatures. โ€I think the authors have done a good job,โ€ said David Wacey, who researches the origins and evolution of life at the University of Western Australia. With the new evidence, he said, โ€One comes up with a pretty convincing biological scenarioโ€ for the origins of the mysterious rock features. Dr. Wacey was not surprised that the new work had drawn criticism. โ€It may be many years before a consensus is reached,โ€ he said. โ€But this is how science progresses. โ€",0
183,Pro-Government Forces Advance in Syria Amid Talk of U.S.-Russia Cooperation - The New York Times,Anne Barnard and Karam Shoumali,"BEIRUT, Lebanon  โ€”   In Moscow on Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry and Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov of Russia laid bunches of flowers in memory of the victims of the truck attack in Nice, France, then spent hours debating proposals for new cooperation in Syria. But the discussions, aimed at fighting terrorism and restarting political talks to end the war, took place against a backdrop of new carnage in Syria, where a very different dynamic is playing out.   forces are tightening a new siege around the countryโ€s largest city, Aleppo, amid intense bombing. Farther south, they are on the verge of overrunning the   Damascus suburb of Daraya, one of the first to rebel against the government of President Bashar   five years ago. They have stepped up airstrikes, hitting marketplaces and tent camps, as civilians trapped behind blockades continue to die for lack of food and medical care. Both supporters and opponents of Mr. Assad say he and his allies are seeking to press their military campaign as far as it can go before January, when a new American president might take a tougher line in Syria. Even as the Syrian government periodically issues declarations of temporary   that policy is playing out with devastating effect on the ground in Syria. The siege that people on the   side of Aleppo have dreaded for years seems to have arrived this week, adding to besieged areas across the country where aid groups say one million people are already trapped. The only road connecting the city to the border with Turkey and   countryside has long been subject to airstrikes. But after recent advances, government forces can now rake it with artillery and   fire. The United Nations and international aid groups are raising alarms, saying that food, medicine and medical personnel are unable to reach the city. โ€We need to be able to reach eastern Aleppo,โ€ Jan Egeland, the United Nations humanitarian adviser to the special envoy on Syria, said in Geneva on Friday, estimating that about 250, 000 people still live there. โ€It is on the verge of becoming yet another besieged location  โ€”   our largest. โ€ The fear in Aleppo is that the government will surround it and starve and shell it until it surrenders, as it did with Homs, a smaller city, where a siege of the downtown lasted more than two years and left virtually every building damaged. But Aleppo is far larger, and such a siege would be longer and bloodier. Abdul Ghani Shoubak, a lawyer and member of the local council who made it into the city last week from Turkey, is now not sure when he will be able to make it out. Signs of siege are already evident, he said. โ€Sugar and eggs disappeared from the market, and it is hard to find cooking gas,โ€ Mr. Shoubak, 30, said in a telephone interview. He said that the council was trying to ration food for the public, but that the biggest problem was the inability to evacuate the wounded. โ€We counted 150 air raids and 450 barrel bombs in the past two days,โ€ he said, speaking of the primitive bombs, filled with nails and other shrapnel, that the Syrian government uses. Rebels also increased their shelling of the   side and, as usual, civilians bore the brunt of it. Scores of people died on each side throughout the week. There have been more than 300 attacks on medical facilities during the war, according to the advocacy group Physicians for Human Rights. The vast majority were carried out by the government or its allies, and Aleppo has been one of the hardest hit areas. There are just a few dozen doctors left for a population of 300, 000, according to a physician who works for the cityโ€s only pediatric hospital, the Childrenโ€s Hospital of Aleppo, even after several colleagues died in the bombing of another facility, the Quds Hospital, earlier this year. โ€This tells us that they are trying to displace people, forcing them to leave the city,โ€ the doctor, who uses a nickname, Dr. Hatem, for safety, said in a phone interview. โ€They have no problem in targeting anything. โ€ Daraya, a suburb of Damascus, the capital, has held out for so long that residents find it hard to believe that government tanks are suddenly threatening to split the town. It lies just south of Damascus, close to major roads and military installations, and is a   symbol for both the government and its opponents. Rebels there are running out of arms and ammunition as the government, backed by Russia, Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, has slowly retaken supply routes. Daraya was one of the first towns to revolt, first with peaceful protests, where residents such as Ghiath Mattar, who would hand roses to soldiers and police officers, inspired imitators around the country before he was detained and tortured to death. Later, Daraya was one of the first of the   suburbs around Damascus to take up arms, and to be attacked with artillery and helicopters. In a 2012 massacre, numerous witnesses reported at the time, hundreds were killed with knives by government militias. Just a few thousand people are left in Daraya now, and they have been besieged so long that they remain a kind of time capsule of the original 2011 revolt the rebels controlling the town are local residents, not led by foreign jihadists, and the leaders of the local council took part in early protests. That is why Muhammad Shihadeh, a member of the local council, fears retaliation if government troops take the town: The government, he said, wants to eliminate any alternative model. โ€Daraya joined the peaceful revolution, and exported peaceful activists,โ€ Mr. Shihadeh said. โ€It had a   local council, and this all gave Daraya a value that made it a target for the regime. If the regime manages to enter this area, we are expecting massacres against the civilians. โ€ Daraya went without any United Nations aid until June, when a single delivery took place, providing what was supposed to be a monthโ€s supply for 4, 000 people, but Mr. Shihadeh said there were twice that many civilians in need. Even the smuggling routes that had enabled the delivery of exorbitantly priced food have been cut off, he said people are surviving on rice, lentils and greens they grow on rooftops and in empty lots. Residents say they are getting hungrier as rebels have lost agricultural areas on the outskirts. โ€People use whatever expired medicine they find in destroyed houses,โ€ Mr. Shihadeh said. โ€Most people have one meal a day. โ€ Daraya got a brief respite from the bombing for a few weeks beginning in March, under a   brokered by the United States and Russia, but in recent weeks it has been bombarded daily. Residents are asking for a renewal of the truce and airdrops of food if the government continues to deny permission for convoys. Aleppo and Daraya are just two highly symbolic areas facing new stresses, but similar scenes are unfolding around the country, raising questions about whether Russia has the will or the ability to press the Syrian government to stop targeting civilians or to allow aid deliveries. In Madaya, for instance, the town near Damascus where images of starvation galvanized international pressure for aid access this year, people are continuing to die from malnutrition after treatment kits were removed from the few convoys that went through. The last one was on April 30. There have been 86 preventable deaths there since the siege began last year, including 65 related to malnutrition, according to Physicians for Human Rights and the Syrian American Medical Society. โ€Starvation is backโ€ in Madaya, Mr. Egeland said. โ€It will be a debacle for all of us if we have the same images coming out of Madaya which were there when we started our work. โ€",0
184,WHO cancer agency under fire for withholding โ€carcinogenic glyphosateโ€ documents,RT,"WHO cancer agency under fire for withholding โ€carcinogenic glyphosateโ€ documents Published time: 27 Oct, 2016 01:32 Get short URL ยฉ Philippe Huguen / AFP The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), facing criticism over its classification of carcinogens, has reportedly been advising its scientific experts not to publish internal research data on its 2015 report on โ€probably carcinogenicโ€ glyphosate. 
The IARC urged its scientists not to publish research documents on its 2015 weedkiller glyphosate review, according to Reuters. The agency told Reuters on Tuesday that it tried to protect the study from โ€external interference,โ€ as well as protect its intellectual rights, since it was โ€the sole owner of such materials.โ€ 
The scientists had been asked earlier to release all the documentation on the 2015 report under US freedom of information laws. 
The groundbreaking review, published in March 2015 by the IARC โ€“ a semi-autonomous agency of the World Health Organization (WHO) โ€“ labeled the glyphosate herbicide as โ€probably carcinogenic to humans.โ€ Glyphosate is a key ingredient of Monsantoโ€s flagship weedkiller well-known under the trade name โ€Roundup.' It is one of the most heavily used herbicides in the world and is designed to go along with genetically-modified โ€Roundup Readyโ€ crops, also produced by Monsanto. Read more EU may ban Monsanto weedkiller over health concerns 
The IARCโ€s report caused problems for both the notorious agrochemical giant and the agency itself. 
The report sparked a heated debate around the use of Roundup, and caused several EU countries โ€“ including France, Sweden, and the Netherlands โ€“ to object to the renewal of the glyphosateโ€s EU license. The vote on prolonging the glyphosate license for 15 years failed several times in June 2016, but the license was temporarily extended for 18 months during last hours before its expiration. 
The controversial report has seemingly made the IARC a target for attacks from multiple directions, and raised scientific, legal, and financial questions. 
Various critics, including those in the chemical industry, said the IARC's evaluations are fuel for โ€unnecessary health scares,โ€ since the IARC allegedly studies the potentially harmful substance itself, and not a โ€typical humanโ€ exposure to it. It remained unclear whether the critics urged a WHO body to test the potentially carcinogenic chemical on humans. 
The critics also brought up other controversial statements from the IARC, over whether such things as mobile phones, coffee, red meat, and processed meat could cause cancer. 
The agency defended its methods as scientifically sound and โ€widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and...freedom from conflicts of interest.โ€ Numerous freedom of information requests by the Energy & Environment Legal Institute (E&E Legal), a US conservative advocacy group, have since been turned down with this reasoning. Read more Bayer vows not to use reputation to impose Monsantoโ€s GM crops on Europe 
E&E Legal told Reuters that it is pushing a legal challenge over whether the documents in question belong to the IARC or to the US federal and state institutions where some of the experts work. Basically, itโ€s being decided whether the IARC, as part of the WHO, is truly independent and free from โ€conflicts of interest.โ€ 
According to Reuters, officials from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) will be questioned by a congressional committee about why American taxpayers fund the cancer agency, which faces much criticism over its allegedly faulty classification of carcinogens. 
โ€IARCโ€s standards and determinations for classifying substances as carcinogenic, and therefore cancer-causing, appear inconsistent with other scientific research, and have generated much controversy and alarm,โ€ a letter from US Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to NIH director Francis Collins states, as quoted by Reuters. 
The Oversight Committee demanded a full disclosure of NIH funding of the IARC, and even money spent in relation to the cancer agencyโ€s activities.

IARC opponents from scientific circles vowed to provide their data on the matter. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which believes glyphosate is โ€unlikely pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans,โ€ promised to release its raw data on the subject as part of its โ€commitment to open risk assessment.โ€ The food safety watchdog made this statement in late September, and still has to deliver the promised information.",1
185,Work. Walk 5 Minutes. Work. - The New York Times,Gretchen Reynolds,"Stuck at your work desk? Standing up and walking around for five minutes every hour during the workday could lift your mood, combat lethargy without reducing focus and attention, and even dull hunger pangs, according to an instructive new study. The study, which also found that frequent, brief walking breaks were more effective at improving   than a single, longer walk before work, could provide the basis for a simple, realistic New Yearโ€s exercise resolution for those of us bound to our desks all day. There is growing evidence, of course, that long bouts of uninterrupted sitting can have undesirable physical and emotional consequences. Studies have shown that sitting motionless reduces blood flow to the legs, increasing the risk for atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaques in the arteries. People who sit for more than eight or nine hours daily, which for many of us describes a typical workday, also are at heightened risk for diabetes, depression and obesity compared with people who move more often. In response, researchers and some bosses have proposed a variety of methods for helping people reduce their sitting time at work, including standing workstations and treadmill desks. But such options are cumbersome and costly, making them impractical for many work situations. Some experts have worried, too, that if people are physically active at the office, they might subsequently become more tired, grumpy, distracted or hungry, any of which could have an undesirable effect on work performance and   health. So for the new study, which was published in November in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute and other institutions decided to test several methods of increasing movement among office workers. (The study was funded largely by Johnson  Johnson, with additional support from the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center.) To start, the researchers invited 30 sedentary adult office workers to a university clinic to complete a battery of health tests and questionnaires. The researchers measured their heart rates and stress hormone levels and asked them to rank, on a numerical scale, how energetic or tired they felt, as well as how happy they were, and whether they were feeling peckish or had little appetite just then. The volunteers also completed computerized games designed primarily to test their ability to concentrate and make decisions. Then, on three subsequent visits to the clinic, each volunteer simulated a   workday. During one visit, the volunteers sat for the whole time with no interruptions, except for bathroom breaks. During another, they walked moderately for 30 minutes at the start of their experimental day, and then sat for the next five and a half hours with no additional scheduled breaks. Finally, during a third visit, the volunteers sat for most of the six hours, but began each hour with five minutes of moderate walking, using treadmills at the clinic. At the start and end of each session, the researchers drew blood to check levels of stress hormones. And periodically throughout each day, they asked their volunteers to numerically rate their moods, energy, fatigue and appetites. The volunteers also repeated the computerized testing of their thinking skills at the close of each session. The researchers then analyzed the data. The numbers showed that on almost all measures, the subjectsโ€ ratings of how they were feeling rose when they did not sit for six uninterrupted hours. They said that they felt much more energetic throughout the day if they had been active, whether that activity was bunched into a single longish walk at the start of the day or distributed into multiple brief breaks. On other measures, though, the   walks were more potent than the concentrated   version. When the workers rose most often, they reported greater happiness, less fatigue and considerably less craving for food than on either of the other days. Their feelings of vigor also tended to increase throughout the day, while they often had plateaued by early afternoon after walking only once in the morning. There were no differences on the scores on the cognitive tests, whether they sat all day or got up and moved. Stress hormones also remained steady during each visit. These results suggest that โ€even a little bit of activity, spread throughout the day, is a practical, easy way to improve โ€ says Jack Groppel, a study author and a founder of the Johnson  Johnson Human Performance Institute. He points out that the walking breaks did not cause people to feel more tired or hungry, but instead had the opposite effect. They also did not alter peopleโ€s ability to focus, so, in theory, should not affect productivity (for good or ill). This study, however, was small in scale,   and limited by its dependence on the volunteersโ€ perceptions of their responses to the experiment. But even so, โ€itโ€s clear that moving matters,โ€ Dr. Groppel says. So set your 2017 appointment calendar, he suggests, to devote five minutes every hour to physical activity, whether you walk up and down a staircase, along a corridor or just pace around your office.",0

Militants have launched a toxic gas attack near the international airport in the Syrian city of Aleppo , the Lebanon-based TV channel, Al Mayadeen TV, reported Sunday. 
The report says that miliants used projectiles with poisonous gas during the artillery shelling of the Syrian armyโ€s positions at the Aleppo international airport. At least 28 Syrian servicemen were reported injured. 
Earlier this week, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that Russian military experts had found evidence that militants had used chemical weapons (chlorine and white phosphorus) in Aleppo city. The ministry send samples of soil and shell fragments found in Aleppo to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). 
Despite numerous reports of militantsโ€ use of chemical weapons, the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) expert panel keeps its line to blame the Syrian government for almost every chemical attack since the start of the war.

187,Steve Harvey Talks Housing With President-Elect Trump - The New York Times,Sopan Deb,"Steve Harvey, the comedian and television host, became the latest celebrity to ascend Trump Tower on Friday to discuss federal policy with   Donald Trump, in this case housing issues. But before Mr. Harvey was off the premises, he unexpectedly revived a recent controversy over his comments about Asian men. After the meeting, Mr. Trump and Mr. Harvey briefly appeared together in the lobby. When Mr. Trump left, Mr. Harvey said they had discussed ways he could work with Ben Carson, Mr. Trumpโ€s nominee to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Mr. Harvey has spoken openly in the past of being homeless as an adult while struggling to start his comedy career, though he gave no reason on Friday for why he was consulted on housing affairs. Mr. Harvey said he was invited a week ago by โ€both transition teams,โ€ referring to representatives of President Obama and Mr. Trump, and emphasized that the visit was informal. โ€Well, you know itโ€s not my jump into politics,โ€ Mr. Harvey said. โ€I ainโ€t gonna pass a background check. Itโ€s just me following orders from my friend President Obama who said, โ€Steve, you gotta,โ€ as he told everybody, โ€get out from behind your computer, stop tweeting and texting and get out there and sit down and talk. โ€โ€ The Trump team confirmed the invitation. The White House did not comment. Mr. Harvey announced his support for Mr. Trumpโ€s opponent, Hillary Clinton, last March in the presidential primaries. In September, during an interview with her on โ€The Steve Harvey Morning Showโ€ on iHeartRadio, he said: โ€Sheโ€s a mother, sheโ€s a grandmother, and weโ€re going to put her back in the White House, just flat out. Simply put. โ€ This was just the latest     crossover for Mr. Trump during his transition. Last month the   surprised reporters at Trump Tower by posing for photographs in the lobby with Kanye West. For Mr. Harveyโ€s part, he said that the incoming president was โ€a great guyโ€ and โ€genuine. โ€ He deflected questions about Mr. Trumpโ€s history of questionable comments regarding race from the campaign trail, and was diplomatic about his doubts about Mr. Trump. โ€You donโ€t kill it with one conversation, but you can start it with the conversation,โ€ Mr. Harvey said. โ€So, you know, a lot about what people say, โ€Now, well, itโ€s time to see what you do.โ€ And he said he wanted to do something. โ€ Mr. Harvey also mentioned a controversy in which, during his television show last week, he mocked the dating skills of Asian men. At Trump Tower, Mr. Harvey said, unprompted, that he hadnโ€t laughed recently as a result of the controversy. โ€I ainโ€t been laughing that much over the past few days,โ€ Mr. Harvey said. โ€Theyโ€re kinda beating me up on the internet right now for no reason. But, you know, thatโ€s life, ainโ€t it?โ€ After the meeting, Mr. Harvey put out a message on Twitter, saying that he found Mr. Trump โ€congenial and sincereโ€ and that he would โ€sit with him anytime. โ€ Here are some edited excerpts from Mr. Harveyโ€s conversation with reporters in Trump Tower: REPORTER: There have been a lot of doubts about this administration about race. Jeff Sessions, his record in Alabama, some of the things the   said during the campaign about the inner cities. Are your doubts fully gone or are you going to still try and work them out? STEVE HARVEY: Well, I mean, you know, look, you donโ€t kill it with one conversation, but you can start it with the conversation. So, you know, a lot about what people say, now, well, itโ€s time to see what you do. And he said he wanted to do something. You canโ€t beat better than that. You know, and so, weโ€re gonna see. Iโ€ve been put in contact with Ben Carson, which was great, I spoke with him. And so, weโ€re gonna get some things started, and they have a plan for the inner cities but they need help. And so, thatโ€s why they called me. So weโ€ll see what I can do. REPORTER: Do you have any lingering things you still want to talk further about, that youโ€re still concerned about, you havenโ€t heard quite what you wanted to hear yet? HARVEY: Well, I mean for this, we got off to a great start. I think it could be the beginning of something. For them to invite me here to talk about a specific problem and thought that I might be able to help  โ€”   I know I got a big radio show, I got a lot of people listening every morning. So Iโ€ve always been concerned about inner city problems because theyโ€re huge. My mentoring problem, excuse me, my mentoring program has been a part of this type of  โ€”   and thatโ€s what I want to see happen. And they were spot on with it. And Ben Carson got on the phone. I met with him over the phone today, but I sat with   Trump and we laughed a little bit. I ainโ€t been laughing that much over the past few days. Theyโ€re kinda beating me up on the internet right now for no reason. But, you know, thatโ€s life, ainโ€t it? REPORTER: What did you laugh over? HARVEY: Well we talked about golf. We laughed about my score in golf, his score in golf, we talked about some of the friends that we have in common. Mark Burnett. Talked about TV shows. Things like that. Heโ€s a fan. So heโ€s seen it. I met his daughter, she was very sweet. So I think weโ€re off to a good start.",0
188,Coalition: U.S. Troops Fighting in Mosul Offensive โ€Come Under Fireโ€,Edwin Mora,"U. S service members participating in the ongoing offensive to recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State โ€have come under fire,โ€ Col. John Dorrian, a spokesman for the U. S.  coalition, told Pentagon reporters. [โ€They have come under fire at different times, our forces that have been in Mosul and other places around Iraq,โ€ revealed Col. Dorrian.  โ€What I would tell you, though, is that they are directed to try and be positioned where that is a rarity and unlikely to occur,โ€ he added. Without providing a specific figure, an unnamed U. S. defense official told some news outlets that American forces taking part in the Mosul operation had suffered injuries. U. S. troops have been providing advice and assistance to an alliance of tens of thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga troops, and   Shiite militiamen fighting to push the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL, out of Mosul. The day after the Mosul offensive began in   Peter Cook,   secretary for the Pentagon, conceded that U. S. troops participating in the operation would be in โ€harmโ€s way. โ€ โ€Some [U.

S. forces remain in a position to be able to provide advice to them,โ€ he added. โ€A small number will be in a position to provide that advice on the ground. โ€ The U. S.  Iraqi forces and their allies have liberated eastern Mosul. On Sunday, the Iraqi alliance began its mission to retake the western side of the city, considered one of ISISโ€s last major strongholds in the country. Since 2014, ISIS has held Mosul, Iraqโ€s   city. An estimated 2, 000 jihadists are believed to be still fighting to keep Mosul under ISISโ€s control. The U. S.  Iraqi forces and their allies have recently recaptured Mosulโ€s airport.",0
189,UK citizens and war heroes get cheap pre-fab houses while Muslim colonizers get taxpayer-funded luxurious council homes,BareNakedIslam,"UK citizens and war heroes get cheap pre-fab houses while Muslim colonizers get taxpayer-funded luxurious council homes UK Ministers have been forced to put forward plans for pre-fabricated homes after 30,000 luxury council houses were handed out to unemployed illegal alien Muslim migrants. Migration Watch said the costs will continue to rocket if a โ€sustainableโ€ level of migration is not achieved. UK Daily Mail More than 11,000 households are raking in benefits that are at least the equivalent of a higher rate taxpayersโ€ ยฃ47,000 salary, it was revealed last month. According to official figures, thousands of Muslim migrant families on benefits are living in luxury homes, with many receiving housing handouts of about ยฃ5,000 per month โ€“ enough to fund a ยฃ1million mortgage. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayersโ€ Alliance, said: โ€Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than theyโ€ve ever actually earned themselves. UK Express (h/t Rob E) A spokesperson said: โ€There is a long standing controversy over the granting of social housing to immigrants. This has not been helped by local authoritiesโ€ reluctance to publish the relevant information. โ€Some immigrant groups have very low use of social housing whereas others are more likely to be in social housing than the UK born. There is absolutely nothing in the rules that state that immigrants should get preferential treatment. โ€However, priority for social housing is largely determined by need and so some โ€high needโ€ immigrant families (with multiple wives and large litters of kids) will gain access to housing over longer standing local residents deemed to be of lower need. This can be contentious. The 100,000 pre-fab homes(below) proposed by the Government are a far cry from those properties โ€fit for heroesโ€ and service personnel who were awarded social housing on their return from the horrors of the First World War. โ€In the future, any housing strategy must address both supply and demand. The Muslim invasion is a major part of housing demand. โ€Unless net migration is reduced to a manageable and sustainable level a large house building programme will have to continue indefinitely, with all the costs and loss of amenities involved.โ€ A white paper due out next month includes measures to encourage banks to lend to firms which construct off-site before delivering them to their final destination. A Government source said: โ€The first and most obvious advantage is speeding up the building of housing. โ€There is pretty good evidence that if you did it at scale it is cheaper.โ€ This has pushed ministers to plan a new wave of pre-made homes to solve the housing crisis. The prefabricated homes can be built off site in as little as a day and take just 48 hours to install on a site. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayersโ€ Alliance, said: โ€Many taxpayers struggling to make ends meet will find it incredibly unfair that some people are drawing more in benefits than theyโ€ve ever actually earned themselves. But today when approximately 9,000 of our servicemen and women are sleeping rough after leaving the military, Government figures show how an influx of Muslims has seen 30,000 social housing lettings given to immigrants in 2015. Outrage as Afghan War hero who guarded the Queen is thrown out of council home From 2015, Jamie Streets, 34, spent 15 years in the Household Cavalry and suffered brain damage while on duty. But he, his wife Charmaine and their four children are to be kicked out of temporary accommodation after Cornwall County Council denied them a permanent home. Mr Streets served in both Kosovo and Afghanistan and escorted the Queen on ceremonial duty, holding the rank of corporal of horse. But he was discharged on medical grounds last year after suffering serious head injuries and a brain tumor.

194,Death of the โ€Two-State Solutionโ€,Consortiumnews.com,"Death of the โ€Two-State Solutionโ€ November 16, 2016 
Exclusive: For years, anyone calling for a โ€one-state solutionโ€ to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict โ€“ granting equal rights to all inhabitants and thus โ€dilutingโ€ the โ€Jewish stateโ€ โ€“ was denounced as anti-Semitic. But Israelโ€s persistent settlement building has now left no other rational choice, notes Jonathan Marshall. 
By Jonathan Marshall 
Donald Trumpโ€s election victory raises many unanswered questions, but it also settles a few, starting with the fate of the Israeli-Palestinian โ€peace process.โ€ In the words of Israeli Education Minister and Jewish Home Party leader Naftali Bennett, โ€The era of a Palestinian state is over.โ€ 
Lest anyone accuse the Israeli hardliner of wishful thinking, one need only recall candidate Trumpโ€s insistence last spring that Israelis โ€really have to keep goingโ€ with settling the territories that they have occupied since 1967. Two months later, the Republican Party changed its 2012 platform to omit support for a Palestinian state and to condemn the โ€false notion that Israel is an occupier.โ€   talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they walk across the tarmac at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv, Israel, March 20, 2013. (Official White House Photo by Pete Souza) 
Last week, a co-chair of the Trump campaignโ€s Israel Advisory Committee reaffirmed that the President-elect rejects Washingtonโ€s traditional view that Israelโ€s settlements are obstacles to peace and illegal under international law. 
The so-called โ€two-state solutionโ€ โ€” creation of a Palestinian national homeland comprising the West Bank and Gaza, and coexisting with Israel โ€” has been a longstanding axiom of official U.S. policy, accepted as well by Israel and its unofficial lobbying arm, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. 
Of late, however, the rise of extreme Jewish nationalists to power in Israel, the relentless expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories, and Israelโ€s evident disinterest in peace negotiations have all but killed hopes for such a solution. In 2015, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared , โ€There will be no withdrawalsโ€ from the occupied West Bank and โ€no concessionsโ€ to the Palestinians. 
As Americans for Peace Now points out, โ€more than 40% of the West Bank is under the direct control of settlers or settlements and off-limits to Palestinians . . . Israel has taken hundreds of kilometers of the West Bank to build roads that serve the settlements, . . . dividing Palestinian cities and towns from each other, and imposing various barriers to Palestinian movement and access. . . Such settlements, and new settlement construction going on today, have the explicit goal of preventing the establishment of a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem โ€“ which, in effect, means preventing the two-state solution.โ€ 
Many of Israelโ€s staunchest allies in the United States now concede this reality. Hillary Clinton, in a private email to one of her advisers, acknowledged in 2015 that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process had become a phony โ€Potemkinโ€ spectacle. Secretary of State John Kerry warned publicly that Israeli settlement-building was โ€imperiling the viability of a two-state solution.โ€ 
Roger Cohen, the New York Times columnist and an ardent liberal Zionist, reported last month following a trip to Israel that the two-state idea is all but โ€clinically dead.โ€ He explained: โ€The incorporation of all the biblical Land of Israel has advanced too far, for too long, to be reversed now.โ€ 
Many Israeli supporters of a two-state solution now publicly admit that bitter truth. Former Prime Minister Ehud Barak accuses Netanyahu of engaging in a โ€messianic driveโ€ toward โ€a single Jewish state, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.โ€ For the current crop of right-wing leaders in Israel, the main question is whether to offer Palestinians citizenship within an expanded Israel or to remove them. 
Palestinians also concede privately that their dream of a state is dead. Said noted Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, โ€We, Israelis and Palestinians, live in a one-state reality.โ€ Former Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei, declared bluntly, โ€there will be no alternative but one state. No alternative.โ€ 
What Path Forward? 
If a Palestinian state is truly dead, Palestinians will need to give up their decades-old nationalist aspirations, a wrenching blow that many will find hard to accept. Israelis, in turn, will need to find room in a bi-national democratic state for millions of Palestinians โ€” roughly equal in number to Jews โ€” an even more wrenching adjustment that many will fight to the bitter end. Liberal Zionists have warned for years that refusal to accept a Palestinian state would force Israel to choose between remaining a democratic state or a Jewish state. A map showing Israeli settlements in the Palestinian Territories. 
As former Prime Minister Barak put it , the โ€overarching ambitionโ€ of absorbing the occupied territories โ€is bound to culminate in either a single, binational state, which, within a generation, may have a Jewish minority and likely a Bosnia-like civil war, or else an apartheid reality if Palestinian residents are deprived of the right to vote. Both spell doom for the Zionist dream.โ€ 
An apartheid-like reality already exists for Palestinians, but many Israelis and their supporters publicly rationalize it as an unfortunate but temporary necessity during a transitional period that will end with a peace settlement. By putting off determination of the final status of the occupied territories, Israel can justify subjecting Palestinians to harsh military law , seizing their land, demolishing their homes, controlling their movements, and jailing them at will rather than granting them the rights afforded to Israeli citizens. 
Israeli political scientist and former deputy mayor of Jerusalem Meron Benvenisti has been saying for years that โ€the whole notion of a Palestinian state . . . is a sham.โ€ Israel has maintained the pretense of peace talks only โ€because it is self-serving,โ€ he said. While talking about two states as a goal, Israeli governments continue funding the expansion of settlements. Palestinian officials, meanwhile, help enforce order in return for millions of dollars in international aid. 
But if Israeli hardliners succeed in ending the fiction of a peace process and annex the territories , โ€then the Palestinian struggle will inevitably be transformed from one demanding independence into a movement demanding equal rights,โ€ says James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute. โ€If this is to be the case, we may well see the day when the Palestinian citizens of Israel will emerge . . . as the new leadership of a unified Palestinian community fighting for justice and equality.โ€ 
Such a fight will face tremendous opposition. In recent years, polls of Israeli adults show that nearly half believe Arabs should be expelled from Israel. Nearly eight in 10 believe Jews should receive preferential treatment compared to non-Jews. The Netanyahu government and Knesset are filled with overt racists. Last year, Netanyahu appointed as deputy defense minister a rabbi who asserted , โ€[Palestinians] are like animals, they arenโ€t human.โ€ 
The Israeli peace activist and public opinion analyst Dahlia Scheindlin doesnโ€t minimize the hurdles, but said Palestinians may be ready to fight for their rights within Israel. โ€Israeli racism [is] better than Israeli occupation,โ€ she wrote , โ€and they probably feel [they] can live with it as long as there are democratic foundations to demand better. Maybe for them, Israeli rule cannot possibly make their status quo worse, but at least it offers the possibility of something many of them simply lack: citizenship.โ€ 
Democratic Rights 
Some hope is offered by the fact that several notable right-leaning Israeli politicians favor granting Palestinians full democratic rights within a greater Israel, rather than subordinating them forever under the thumb of military occupation or Jim Crow-type segregation. A section of the barrier โ€” erected by Israeli officials to prevent the passage of Palestinians โ€” with graffiti using President John F. Kennedyโ€s famous quote when facing the Berlin Wall, โ€Ich bin ein Berliner.โ€ (Photo credit: Marc Venezia) 
As New Yorker editor David Remnick observed a couple of years ago, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin โ€” a member of the rightist Likud party โ€” has โ€emerged as the most prominent critic of racist rhetoric, jingoism, fundamentalism, and sectarian violence, the highest-ranking advocate among Jewish Israelis for the civil rights of the Palestinians both in Israel and in the occupied territories.โ€ 
Rivlin visited an Arab town that had been the scene of an Israeli massacre in 1956 to apologize and โ€swear, in my name and that of all our descendants, that we will never act against the principle of equal rights, and we will never try and force someone from our land.โ€ He also condemned racist fans of a Jerusalem soccer team who protested its signing of two Muslim players. 
For such sentiments, not surprisingly, Rivlin has been called a โ€traitor,โ€ โ€rotten filth,โ€ and even โ€lying little Jewโ€ by his Israeli haters. 
But Rivlin is not alone. Moshe Arens, a former Likud leader, minister of defense and foreign affairs, and ambassador to the United States, supports giving Palestinians in the West Bank the right to vote in Israeli elections. The key to preserving Israeli democracy, he wrote in 2010, will be making them feel at home in the state of Israel, โ€enjoying not only equality of rights but also equality of opportunities.โ€ 
It will take a minor miracle to persuade the Israeli public to risk broadening their democracy to incorporate millions of Palestinians, but the longer the unsupportable status quo prevails, the less likely it becomes that any Israelis will enjoy the democratic and civil rights they have long known. Israelโ€s media is under assault from the government , leading Freedom House to downgrade its assessment of the countryโ€s press from โ€freeโ€ to โ€partly free.โ€ Israeli peace activists and NGOs face constant harassment and persecution . Rightist demonstrators routinely chant โ€Death to Arabs.โ€ 
Former Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon, a member of the Likud Party, recently declared , โ€The leadership of Israel in 2016 is busy with inflaming passions and causing fear between Jews and Arabs, between right and left and between different ethnic groups in order to survive in power.โ€ 
And Ilan Baruch, Israelโ€s former ambassador to South Africa, said , โ€Netanyahu is pushing Israeli democracy to the brink. . . This is the most right-wing government in the countryโ€s history, which has no qualms about taking tactical and strategic steps in the media, education, and culture in order to ensure Netanyahuโ€s permanent rule. To do that, the government sows racist divisions . . . slanders and preaches hatred for the Other โ€” be they Arab citizens of Israel, Palestinians, African refugees, or human rights activists.โ€ 
Still, with the pretense of a two-state solution shattered by Trumpโ€s victory and Netanyahuโ€s open intransigence, supporters of Israeli democracy and Palestinian rights can finally begin an unblinkered discussion of how to achieve a genuine accommodation between those two peoples in a common land. 
In the words of Sandy Tolan, author of the international bestseller The Lemon Tree , โ€Now, at least, there is an opportunity to lay the foundations for some newer kind of solution grounded in human rights, freedom of movement, complete cessation of settlement building, and equal access to land, water, and places of worship. It will have to be based on a new reality, which Israel and the United States have had such a hand in creating. Think of it as the one-state solution.โ€",1
195,"Watch: Police viciously attack, arrest peaceful protesters at DAPL including children and the elderly",nan,"Wed, 26 Oct 2016 13:29 UTC ยฉ The Free Thought Project Dramatic video from Intercept reporter, Jihan Hafiz , was released this week from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests showing a full on assault by militarized police on peaceful people. The video is from Saturday but took several days to be released as cops confiscated the camera used to film it. The video was taken as water protectors and reporters covering the protests marched toward the construction site. However, their peaceful walk was swiftly interrupted by militarized shock troops armed with massive cans of pepper spray, batons, rubber bullets, and assault rifles. According to Hafiz, the march was undertaken in solidarity with several protesters who had chained themselves to bulldozers and pipeline machinery at the construction site. But the marchers never made it to their destination. Instead, they were attacked by police forces who used pepper spray and beat protesters with batons. Dozens of officers, backed by military trucks, police vans, machine guns, and nonlethal weapons, violently approached the group without warning. ""Don't move, everyone is under arrest,"" a voice says from the military vehicle that appears to be equipped with a Long Range Acoustic Hailing Device, or LRAD. As protesters attempted to leave, the police surrounded them and began their attack. According to Hafiz, several women were targeted for leading the march and dragged from the crowd to be arrested. Police body slammed one man and another woman's ankle was broken as she ran. The militarized police then circled the protesters in an apparent move to 'kettle' them โ€” a tactic usually reserved for urban protests in which riot police force large crowds into corners to seemingly provoke them. However, the protesters stayed entirely peaceful. Police continued their mass arrests even though the people were trying to leave. Some natives were seen running for the hills as the assault began. One officer is seen in military camouflage with a ski mask and a tear gas grenade launcher โ€” as if he were going to war . In total, reports Hafiz, more than 140 people were detained in half an hour. It was the largest roundup of protesters since the movement against the pipelines intensified two months ago. A majority of those arrested were charged with rioting and criminal trespass. Overall, close to 300 people have been arrested since protests against the pipeline kicked off over the summer. Among those arrested were journalists, a teen child who was also pregnant, and an elderly woman. They were all brought to the jail where protesters were forced to sit in the jail's common area as police had no other place to put them. According to Hafiz, women were strip searched, protesters were refused phone calls, and no one received food or water. One woman even had her medication confiscated by police, causing her to shake and sweat profusely. When Hafiz was finally released, she attempted to get back her camera and was told that she could not have it back. ""Your camera is being held as evidence in a crime,"" they said. In the land of the free, filming cops assault peaceful men, women, and children is considered a 'crime.' Over the past several weeks, the police state has come out in full force as Native Americans fight to protect their water sources from the threat of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Mainstream media has remained largely silent as federal, state and local authorities worked on behalf of Energy Transfer Partners to squash dissent. Even prominent journalists, like Hafiz, have found themselves targets of the State, charged with dubious ""crimes"" such as "" inciting a riot "" and "" conspiracy to theft of services "" - for doing nothing more than filming protests and the ensuing violent crackdowns. As the video below shows, the First Amendment is no obstacle when it comes to advancing the interests of the corporatocracy. Comment: We are one breath away from an all out massacre!",1

Inglewood, CA โ€” On Sunday, police responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle parked on Manchester Boulevard around 3:10 am. When police arrived, they engaged in a 45-minute long standoff before opening fire on the man and woman inside the vehicle, killing them both. 
In the news release on Monday, following the shooting, police claimed that the woman in the car had a gun. Scott Collins, a spokesman for the Inglewood Police Department said that the couple refused to obey the officersโ€ commands to exit the vehicle. The officers then feared for their safety and opened fire on the car โ€” killing the couple. 
The woman was pronounced dead shortly after the shooting, and the man succumbed to his injuries after paramedics transported him to a local hospital, according to the LA Times. 
The shooting seemed like an open and shut case until the next day. Mayor James Butts, while responding to questions about the shooting, opened up a huge can of worms โ€” both the man and the woman were unconscious. 
For at least 45 minutes, police attempted โ€to rouseโ€ them in an effort โ€to de-escalate the situation,โ€ said Butts. 
After admitting that the couple was asleep, Butts quickly defended the officers, noting, โ€Obviously at some point they were conscious because somebody felt threatened.โ€ 
However, that notion has yet to be proven and is particularly unlikely due to the fact that not a single officer received so much as a scratch, nor did the couple have any reason to be violent. 
Both of the victims were parents; Kisha Michael, 31, a single mother of three sons, and Marquintan Sandlin, 32, a single father of four daughters. 
Michaelโ€s twin sister Trisha stated the obvious when she said that itโ€s possible that Kisha merely passed out on the way home from their night out. 
Families for both described them as devoted parents who made arrangements for care of their children while they took a night off, according to NBC Los Angeles. 
โ€The police ainโ€t telling us nothing,โ€ said Trisha Michael after being met with tight lips from the department. 
โ€He was a loving father,โ€ said Sandlinโ€s sister Leandra Faulkner. โ€All he cared about was his girls, getting them right.โ€ 
Of course, as is standard procedure for all those killed by police, their arrest records were released to shame them. Michael was on probation for a misdemeanor last year, and 7 years ago, Sandlin was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm in Los Angeles. 
According to his relatives, Sandlin had a โ€rough lifeโ€ but had turned it around and was working as a successful truck driver. 
Sadly, these children will now grow up knowing that their parents were taken from them by cops, scared of a sleeping couple. Share Google + Concerned Citizen

Sadly the government insists that they want to take guns away from civilians, for only police officers have training and are responsible enough to handle guns. Yet, Iโ€ve seen more mass shootings and innocent people dying in the hands of cops than in the hands of โ€irresponsible citizensโ€. Crazy ah? Tracy Walling Otis 
Is that true Marco Emilio Giovanni Maltese? Thatโ€s truly horrifying if so. If you have a source of those statistics, I would appreciate the link for it. I know itโ€s bad. Iโ€m not denying that. But I am even more disgusted if it is that bad. :'( 
Iโ€ve read that cops killed more than 1000 people in the USA in the last 3 years. But Iโ€m sorry I donโ€t have the link, you can search and you will find it easily. I think USA people should be more scared of cops than of terrorists. Alain Vosselman 
Iโ€m stunned.. i can no longer believe this. This is going to be talked about in the future (if we still have one) just as we talk now about Stalinโ€s regimeโ€ฆ or Sadam Husseinโ€sโ€ฆ. or Pol Pot.

The fact that there are enough of these stories coming from america for several to be posted everyday proves how messed up the place is. I would not want to be a black person living in america today. I wouldnโ€t live there at all. Nothing will happen to the officers. They should be sentenced for murder, and receive a full sentence. Police officers over there intruding on peopleโ€s property and killing pets, killing people just walking down the street or washing their car. Iโ€d i was an american the only reason iโ€d want to own a gun was to defend my self against police officers. Ryan Robbins 
You shouldnโ€t believe everything you are reading online. Itโ€s bad right now, but itโ€s not nearly as bad as many are making it out to be. All of these innocent victims are not nearly as innocent as they are initially made out to be. When the truth finally comes out on most of these stories, itโ€s on page 6 and nobody takes the time to post it because it does not fuel there agenda to spread hate and prejudice. Aaron Beedle 
it is true everyone has agendasโ€ฆ im sure there are a lot of people in general dying in america.. but i know from life that the people with the power are usually the assholes. I would say that at least 80% of all male human beings struggle to handle power reasonably. females would be close too. When it is appointed rather than earned, such as when someone is called a police officer and given a weapon that can kill people with ease, people tend to not handle it well. I heard a while ago that some parts of the world do not use equipment they would not fire at themselves. And they are made to. It teaches people restraint. Christopher Rawson

I suppose if โ€everyoneโ€ voted for that one independent/libertarian candidate, then maybe we would have a fighting chance. Sadly that will never happen. The vast majority of people have been brainwashed by the two main parties. With the division they have created they can easily put in any candidate they choose, how can anyone prove that it wasnโ€t predetermined? 
I just watched a news video of this story. The mayor said the couple were passed out when police arrived. โ€Police spent 45 minutes trying to rouse them and de-escalate the situationโ€. How is there a situation to de-escalate if they are passed out? ๅฑฑๅด ใณใญใใฑ

All cops are cowards, never seen one that wasnโ€t a coward and bully. One of the cops got tired of waiting and said โ€gunโ€ that was all the excuse they needed to open fire. What if that was a white couple with a gun in the car,nearly everyone has a gun on person or in the car these days. What if they have a permit or concealed carry permit. Do you fucking think the cops would have fired 62 rounds into that car and killed the white couple, well do you?. If one of the thug cops did holler gun, no one can ever say anything to contradict them. Cops know if only one side is left alive, no one can say otherwise. Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6. That is every cops motto, as they know they are above the laws for mere mortal humans. Linda Brown

As such, Arizona has fewer crimes per capita committed with a firearm as does California. How does extrapolate these facts? Perhaps as Arizonians have come to accept firearms as a know factor in their daily lives, whereas Californians do not. Perhaps Californiaโ€s draconian laws encroach upon human mental health? Whereby inhibiting residents of the State of California to live in fear rather than confidence? 
I for one shall leave this contemptuous State, seeking solitude of which only a truly free society can bring. I shall make Arizona my final resting place. (I expect in this forum environment, there may be egregious comments to the โ€final resting placeโ€). ?

Department of justice has statistics on police killings and being white doesnโ€t make you immune, in fact MORE whites were killed by police than blacks in the last 20 years.

The entire legal system is skewed, in favor of those who have money. No doubt black folks are unfairly targeted/abused/killed by cops, but us poor white folks get cop abuse as well, but us poor whites donโ€t seem to be killed by cops as often as black folks. 
That being said, I recently moved to a very rural county and the Sherriffโ€s Deputies here are stand-up good guys. They are not cowards or bullies. That is one reason I moved here. B Alan Eisen

But, more whites than blacks you say..??? Simple, Only Black Lives Matter to the main stream media. Their mission is to promote an agenda to put us common folk against one another.

You Riot when your sports teams lose, or win, for that matter. Percentages sir, say that black men are 21 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. I think if the percentage were reversed, you would be alarmed as well. God bless. Michael McMaster 
To put it in perspective, if police were shooting people in a colourblind fashion then youโ€d expect that for every 100 people shot, 12-13 of them would be black, and 68 would be white. Or to put it another way: Left handed people are about 10% of the population. If it turned out that year after year they were 30% of the people killed by police, it would be fair to ask why they were being singled out disproportionally. Anna Black

I want to see a wrongful death suit brought against them, the police department and the city. Because of these cops 7 children are without their parents.

These cops need to stop it. So weโ€re suppose to believe that this woman and this man with 7 children between them are in a car that late at night just waiting to threaten cops with a gun. Weโ€re REALLY suppose to believe that story? I donโ€t understand how cops can be so afraid when they have a license to carry a gun, training on top of that, a partner, and access to call for backup. I just donโ€t get it. If youโ€re that afraid of a Black person on sight, then you donโ€t need to be a police officer. You need to seek help. Last time I checked, it was Black people getting killed by the police and not the other way around. Yeah, the cops have a handful of tragedies but it cannot compare to the numbers when you talk about deaths of Blacks by police. Not by a longshot. Iโ€m getting really tired of this and the whole USA needs to revamp its law enforcement system. You can give guns to cops who are suppose to protect and serve but where is the protection for the rest of us? Jeff Putterman",1
198,Could Teaching Men to Nurture Counteract Our Culture of Toxic Masculinity?,nan,"By Ann Deslandes / thevocal.com.au 
The feminist and feminist-adjacent internet had a mild implosion in February in response to an article by Canadian organiser, writer, and college professor Nora Samaran (a pseudonym). Titled โ€The opposite of rape culture is nurturance cultureโ€ , Samaran proposes that the solution to rape culture and other manifestations of gendered abuse lies in the inverse of violence, which she says is nurturance โ€“ that is,a deep capacity to create safety and trust that many men are not permitted to develop in patriarchal culture. Patriarchal masculinity, as Samaran observes, teaches men that healthy attachment needs, such as attunement, comfort and responsiveness, or emotional availability are weak and wrong. As such, men become โ€less able to experience women as whole beingsโ€, and are โ€less able to make sense of their own needsโ€. So, as Samaran argues, if men can work together to connect with their capacity to nurture and teach each other the skills and qualities of โ€healthy attachmentโ€, violence against women and non-binary folks might be turned around to its opposite: nurturance. 
As a proposed antidote to rape culture (most recently, most painfully highlighted by the now-viral letter written by the victim of barely-convicted rapist Brock Allen Turner), Nurturance Culture (short title) has been welcomed, argued over, and extended in multiple corners of the social web (and wept over by the MRA ones, natch). 300,000 people from almost every country in the world read the piece in the first week it was posted, and it has been translated into Spanish and Portuguese with more languages likely to come. This is particularly remarkable because Nurturance Culture is not your typical punchy, between-the-eyes manifesto that is easily parsed through social media channels โ€“ itโ€s long; it draws from fields as diverse as neuroscience, psychology, racial justice, cultural theory, and science fiction; and it is concerned with no less than the deep, structural transformation of heteropatriarchal gendered culture. 
When I interviewed Samaran via Skype last month, she suggested that the length and depth of the piece might actually be the reason it had such an impact. In her words, โ€the piece seems to have resonated so deeply because it combines current knowledge about the brain and nervous system with an analysis of powerโ€. And, she observes, this kind of thinking is becoming quietly more common. โ€It seems to me that for those who are paying attention, we are shifting away from cultures of dominance. While on the surface we live in very violent times and so much seems so hopeless, underneath there is a kind of tapping into a vast and deep reservoir of purpose and hope. When you begin to pay attention, you feel and see it emerging on many different fronts seemingly simultaneously. Even in very traditional places this change is happening; we see it in climate scientists beginning to legitimise considering feelings as important sources of information , or the field of medicine beginning to grapple with the possibility of a shared consciousness , itโ€s happening in so many very significant places seemingly independently, such as Black Lives Matter , Indigenous resurgence happening across Turtle Island , the radical mental health movement in work such as The Icarus Project โ€ฆ so much is arising against different forms of dominance simultaneously and it feels like rigid masculinity is one of those forms and is connected to all the others.โ€ 
As Nurturance Culture gained traction, Samaran began inviting people to submit their own descriptions of what the โ€nurturanceโ€ she is proposing looks like, which resulted in dozens of stories of husbands, boyfriends, lovers, friends, brothers, and fathers showing the kind of dependable love and intimate care that is indeed the opposite of hurting, hitting, bashing and raping. This included responses from men keen to share their understanding of the skills of nurturance, such as this one: 
โ€For at least a little while, especially when someone you are with is in need of nurture, let go of your own needs and desires. What does that mean? It means stop thinking about anything related to yourself: how you feel, what you need, what you think is best. Just listen and listen very closely. Try to imagine what it must be like to be this other person: absorb everything you know about their history and experiences and try to embody these. Listen to what they are saying, and repeat it back to them in order to clarify whether or not youโ€ve actually absorbed the essential meaning of what they are communicating to you.โ€ 
Responses like this reflects one of Samaranโ€s intentions for the piece โ€“ in her words, โ€for men to teach one another what they are currently learning individually from women about how to be nurturingโ€. Samaran notes there were unforeseen responses too, such as those who โ€interpreted the piece to mean that men should love and nurture and bond with one another โ€ . On the one hand, โ€men connecting more with other men in a way that skips nurturing women entirely is not really my goalโ€ฆ. Iโ€ve even seen all-male panels on masculine nurturance culture!โ€ she laughs. Still, she adds, โ€I think this piece cracked open an existing profound desire among men to be able to get closer to one another. And that is beautiful โ€“ men want to love each other, to nurture each other, and they donโ€t feel allowed. Thatโ€s one of the big things I hear is being discussed when this piece is used in workshops and discussion groups and conference panels. I just hope they do it in ways that grow their love and capacity to be nurturing to the women and non-binary folks in their lives โ€“ not just to strengthen masculine bonds.โ€ Moreover, the answer to the question โ€Nurturance isโ€ฆ.โ€ must amount to something more than just โ€not raping or assaultingโ€, Samaran adds. โ€Iโ€m saying that โ€nurturance is about learning how to make someone feel safe. Iโ€m saying that it is totally ok to be honest and speak without shame of what we do and donโ€t know, but social scripts about masculinity put a lot of pressure on men to never admit when they donโ€t know something. Itโ€s completely ok to say โ€hey I donโ€t know how to be a safe man, a safe male presence in womenโ€s livesโ€โ€“ because that is about a lot more than just not raping, it is about creating safe connection and spaces in which women and non-binary folks can heal from the massive gendered violence we experience. And, it is about recognising that men need to do this work and teach it to each other because we are already so exhausted from doing it.โ€ 
According to Samaran, another critical aspect of Nurturance Culture that people have responded to is its discussion of shame: โ€On the surface, the shame over not being able to provide what someone needs is massive, and apparently thatโ€s a big thing for men. However, underneath, there is a complex operation of shame going on in masculinity. If you have shamed yourself for having perfectly normal needs, you may not realise that you are doing so, and instead may perceive those same needs as shameful when they appear in other people. You may then actively shame people when they express those same normal needs you have internalised as shameful for yourself. So letโ€s say you learned very early on that needing to be held tenderly and gazed upon lovingly is shameful. You put it away, and canโ€t access it or even remember it. When someone you are lovers with has that very normal and healthy need, instead of comforting her appropriately, you may treat her as shameful and confusing, or become angry and withdrawn, and then blame her for this tension by calling her โ€needyโ€ or โ€unreasonableโ€โ€“ when really it is your own denied need that you are seeing. If you can recognise nurturance needs as completely normal and healthy, you can get your own denied needs met, and also respond in a good way to the needs of a lover, partner, or close friend. Ironically, guilt and shame can be paralysing and can prevent emotional maturity from emerging. We really do need to understand how to work to reduce shame and guilt and increase our cultureโ€s ability to let people be vulnerable. Iโ€m interested in how we create a culture that is safe enough that vulnerability and being completely accepted as our whole selves is taken as a matter of course, as a strength, as a normal part of daily life, not just in our families but in our society across the board. That is how we will move away from shame and guilt and towards accountability and love.โ€ 
Considering Australiaโ€s current crisis of violence against women, I asked Samaran about the role of public, government-sponsored campaigns like โ€The Lineโ€ aimed at raising awareness amongst young people about consent and the impact of intimate partner violence, and the rollout of relationships education in schools where students learn about respectful relationships. Can measures like this complement or help build a nurturance culture? โ€Sureโ€, she replied. โ€Mainstream media and the education system are both central in raising young people so these programs are helpful. Still, programs like the ones you describe are not enough โ€“ theyโ€re not a replacement for the daily, intimate work of building a culture that does the opposite of harm. Programs like this are resources, but letโ€s not overlook where the learning really comes from โ€“ it is deep cultural change we need, and schools can be slow to change.โ€ In this vein, Samaran also encourages readers to consider characters and plots that demonstrate nurturance in popular culture and in existing social movements primarily led by Black and Indigenous people of colour who are creating the world we want to see: โ€when thinking about huge social problems like menโ€s violence, itโ€s so important to think about what the world we want could look like, and where it already looks more like what we want.โ€

199,Donald Trumpโ€s Team Shows Few Signs of Post-Election Moderation - The New York Times,"Eric Lipton, Charlie Savage and Michael S. Schmidt","   Donald J. Trump is picking up the pace with his cabinet and top White House staff choices, and despite the fervent wishes of some Democrats that views expressed during the campaign would be moderated after the election, the new administrationโ€s team is maintaining a decidedly conservative bent. Up next, secretary of defense? James N. Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, will meet the   at Mr. Trumpโ€s New Jersey country club on Saturday to discuss the post of defense secretary, according to two people close to the transition team. Conservatives this spring had wooed General Mattis to run for president as an independent as they sought an alternative to Mr. Trump. While he was receptive to the idea, he ultimately decided against running. โ€The thoughtfulness and patriotism  โ€”   and for that matter, the modesty  โ€”   Jim showed as he reflected on this decision make me more convinced than ever that he would have made a truly admirable president, and also a good candidate,โ€ William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, wrote at the time. General Mattis, 66, is widely respected in the military community and could bring with him a   staff of civilian experts. He was the head of the United States Central Command, which oversees all military operations in the Middle East, from 2010 to 2013 but crossed swords with President Obama over his push for a more aggressive presence in the Persian Gulf. Under federal law, a former military official must be out of uniform for seven years to become defense secretary. General Mattis retired three years ago, and Congress would have to grant him a waiver. But General Mattis is not the only candidate. Senator Tom Cotton, the hawkish military veteran from Arkansas, was in Trump Tower on Friday and is still in the hunt. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trumpโ€s newly appointed chief strategist, has maintained a low profile since the election, but in an interview  in The Hollywood Reporter on Friday, he pushed back against accusations that intended to divide the country along racial lines, even as he embraced his dark image. On the one hand, he said: โ€Iโ€m not a white nationalist, Iโ€m a nationalist. Iโ€m an economic nationalist. โ€ On the other hand, Michael Wolff wrote: Mr. Trumpโ€s association with Mr. Bannon has been widely criticized because of racist conspiracy theories promoted on Breitbart. com, the   news website that Mr. Bannon was managing before joining Mr. Trumpโ€s campaign. Mr. Bannon said in the interview that he expected Mr. Trumpโ€s presidency would unsettle Republicans and Democrats alike with his aggressive and unconventional plans for rebuilding the country. โ€Iโ€m the guy pushing a   infrastructure plan,โ€ Mr. Bannon said. โ€With negative interest rates throughout the world, itโ€s the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. โ€ Predicting a change that will outshine the Reagan revolution, he added: โ€Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. Weโ€re just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks. โ€ He didnโ€t get attorney general. Heโ€s still in the running for secretary of state, though the Trump team has let it be known that the former Trump nemesis Mitt Romney will be meeting with the   to discuss that job. So where is Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and stalwart Trump loyalist? Spotted in Palm Beach, where he says he needs some rest. But donโ€t count him out. When asked whether Mr. Giuliani was a favorite to become secretary of state, Representative Devin Nunes of California, a member of the transition teamโ€s executive committee, said he did not want to speculate. But Mr. Nunes lavished praised on Mr. Giuliani. โ€He would absolutely be a great secretary of state  โ€”   heโ€s Americaโ€s mayor, is widely respected around the world and is a fine example of the type of person we want representing us abroad,โ€ Mr. Nunes said. Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, won a Senate seat last week  โ€”   and with it, one of the worst jobs in American politics: leader of the committee tasked with protecting incumbent colleagues and maybe winning a seat or two in 2018. Senator Chuck Schumer, the incoming minority leader, announced on Friday that Mr. Van Hollen would serve as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for the 2018 cycle. โ€Chris Van Hollen was our first choice for D. S. C. C. chairman because of his talents, his work ethic and his experience,โ€ Mr. Schumer said in a statement. โ€The map is tough for Democrats, but I have no doubt that   Van Hollen is up to the task. โ€ Tough indeed: Democrats gained a mere two Senate seats on Election Day  โ€”   New Hampshire and Illinois  โ€”   and will be defending a daunting 23 seats in 2018, as well as two held by independents who caucus with them  โ€”   Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont  โ€”   and roughly half of those states were won by   Trump. In contrast, Democrats have one real target, Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, and maybe two with Jeff Flake of Arizona if things go south for the new president. (Of note, Mr. Van Hollen knows the highs and lows of the job, having led the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for his partyโ€s 2008 wave, then getting washed out in the 2010 Republican deluge.) For anyone hoping for tempers to cool and partisans to moderate, welcome to the rest of 2016. The choice of Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be attorney general and Representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas to be director of central intelligence  โ€”   as well as Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn to be national security adviser  โ€”   appear to have put to rest talk of a   period after Election Day. Conservative groups are ecstatic. The Trump transition team hailed Mr. Sessions as a champion of civil rights. โ€Senator Sessions is someone whoโ€s universally respected across party lines in the United States Senate,โ€ said Jason Miller, a Trump transition spokesman. The other side? Representative Luis V. Gutiรฉrrez, Democrat of Illinois, said in a statement: โ€If you have nostalgia for the days when blacks kept quiet, gays were in the closet, immigrants were invisible and women stayed in the kitchen, Senator Jefferson Beauregard Sessions is your man. No senator has fought harder against the hopes and aspirations of Latinos, immigrants and people of color than Senator Sessions. โ€ Some Democrats kept their immediate challenges minimal for Mr. Pompeo. โ€As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Pompeo has a firsthand appreciation for Congressโ€ responsibility to provide vigilant oversight of our nationโ€s intelligence activities, and I look forward to learning more about his views,โ€ said Senator Mark R. Warner of Virginia, the incoming Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman. On the other hand, Jon Soltz, chairman of the liberal veterans group VoteVets. org, greeted the selection of Mr. Pompeo by saying, โ€This administration is turning out to be as scary, bigoted and abnormal as most people feared. โ€ As for General Flynn? โ€Michael Flynn has shown a stunning contempt for the Geneva Conventions and other laws prohibiting torture,โ€ said Sarah Margon, Washington director at Human Rights Watch. โ€By offering this key post to Flynn,   Trump is undermining U. S. commitments to international laws that have been broken to Americaโ€s detriment. โ€ Vice   Mike Pence told the news media on Friday that teams of transition staff members who will be working directly with federal agencies had arrived in Washington. โ€The   is a man of action, and weโ€ve got a great number of men and women with great qualifications looking forward to serving in this administration, and I am just humbled to be a part of it,โ€ Mr. Pence said. He added, โ€I am very confident it will be a smooth transition that will serve to lead this country forward and make America great again. โ€ Mr. Pence walked away as a reporter asked whether the   was racist. Mr. Pompeo, the  โ€s pick to direct the C. I. A. may also be a way for Mr. Trump to warm relations with the Koch Industries directors Charles G. and David H. Koch. Mr. Pompeo was first elected to Congress with a large amount of financial support and a prominent public endorsement from the Koch brothers, and the Kansas congressman has remained closely aligned with them since. Individuals associated with Koch Industries are by far the biggest donors to Mr. Pompeoโ€s political career, contributing $357, 000 to him since 2009. The Koch brothers  โ€”   among the biggest players in financing Republican candidates nationwide  โ€”   remained largely on the sidelines in this yearโ€s presidential race. Mr. Pompeo has been a staunch proponent of bringing newly captured terrorism suspects to the prison at Guantรกnamo Bay, Cuba, for interrogation and   detention, as President Obama has refused to do. At a 2013 congressional hearing, Mr. Pompeo called the prison operation in Cuba lawful and humane, and dismissed a hunger strike among the detainees at the time as a โ€political stunt. โ€ โ€We are still engaged in a counterterrorism battle all around the globe that continue to need to have a secure location in which to detain captured enemy combatants remains,โ€ Mr. Pompeo said. Mr. Pompeo has also been a defender of broad government surveillance programs and an opponent of limits the Obama administration imposed after the leaks of the former intelligence contractor Edward J. Snowden. Those included the U. S. A. Freedom Act, which ended the National Security Agencyโ€s   program that collected Americansโ€ domestic calling records in bulk and replaced it with a system in which the government has to get a court order to obtain specific records from phone companies. In an   he   in January, Mr. Pompeo called for rolling back such reforms. Mr. Pompeo was a prominent member of the special House committee that investigated the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Although the panel found no new evidence of wrongdoing by the Obama administration or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Mr. Pompeo and another conservative member of the committee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, were convinced of a wider  . When the committee released its findings in June, the two Republicans filed their own   addendum that was far harsher. The addendum said that the attacks showed that the State Department was โ€seemingly more concerned with politics and Secretary Clintonโ€s legacy than with protecting its people in Benghazi. โ€ โ€With the presidential election just 56 days away, rather than tell the American people the truth and increase the risk of losing an election, the administration told one story privately and a different story publicly,โ€ they concluded. Trey Gowdy, the committeeโ€s chairman and no shrinking violet when it came to Mrs. Clinton, did not put his name on the addendum. The   made quite a boast on Twitter on Thursday. Followed by: The only wrinkle: Ford was never planning to move the plant. During the campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized Ford for moving production to Mexico, and he threatened to impose a 35 percent tariff on vehicles made there. Ford makes the Lincoln MKC, a sport utility vehicle, at a factory in Louisville. Last week, Ford said it planned to move production of the vehicle elsewhere. But Ford had not planned to close the Louisville factory. Instead, it had planned to expand production of another vehicle made in Louisville, the Ford Escape. And the change had not been expected to result in any job losses. โ€Whatever happens in Louisville, it will not lose employment,โ€ Jimmy Settles, a union official, told The Detroit Free Press. โ€They cannot make enough Escapes. โ€",0
200,Miami Beach Tries to Tame Its Most Raucous Street (but the Fishbowl Drinks Can Stay) - The New York Times,Lizette Alvarez,"MIAMI BEACH, Fla.  โ€”   From rooftop bars and rope lines to gridlocked streets and sidewalks, Ocean Drive, the   neon heartbeat of South Beach, can trample the senses on most weekends. Tourists sip Technicolor cocktails from   glasses.   music throbs into the night as people amble along in the glow of   lights. A weed dealer in the shadows peddles โ€Purple Hazeโ€ for $25 as a   older man chases women with a   Burmese python draped around his neck. Police officers are everywhere, scanning the action. โ€It has just gotten to the point where the place has become a       circus, where public safety is no longer ensured,โ€ said Mitch Novick, who owns the Sherbrooke Hotel around the corner on Collins Avenue and has been in the area since 1988, when the cafes here could be counted on one hand. โ€Iโ€m witnessing the blighting of my neighborhood, which was once paradise. โ€ After years of complaints from residents and a steady stream of online criticism from tourists, the City of Miami Beach moved recently to try to tame the epicenter of the mayhem on Ocean Drive, the former gleaming gem of the areaโ€s Art Deco 1990s revival. It was the latest test for a city that has long grappled with how to balance the desires of raucous partygoers with the demands of more sedate visiting families and   residents, many of them wealthy. For Ricky Arriola, a Miami Beach commissioner who is spearheading the crackdown on clutter, noise and crime, the bacchanal along Ocean Drive lurched long ago toward becoming Bourbon Street. A modicum of   sobriety was called for, he said. Two murders this year, including the October shooting death of Lavon Walker, a Brooklyn   activist, brought renewed attention to crime in the area. And the drip of negative Trip Advisor and Yelp reviews describing Ocean Drive as โ€tacky,โ€ โ€seedy,โ€ โ€rough,โ€ โ€overpricedโ€ and teeming with homeless people has not helped. Mr. Arriola, elected commissioner last year, was unsparing in his assessment, saying many cafes are competing in a โ€race to the bottomโ€ and trying to โ€prey on touristsโ€ with    schemes and other scams. Sidewalks are so cluttered with tables and mammoth umbrellas that โ€itโ€s unattractive, unsafe and a breeding ground for crime,โ€ he said. Each business has dueling,   soundtracks blasting from โ€speakers mounted outside, just pumping noise in the street,โ€ he added. And traffic is often at a standstill. The City Commission is gradually tackling these problems, issue by issue. Noise is being curtailed  โ€”   now only restaurants and bars, not shops, can blast music outdoors  โ€”   and there are plans to beautify the street. Smaller umbrellas that donโ€t completely block the Art Deco architecture have been rolled out, and fewer tables crowd the sidewalks. Restaurants will face much steeper fines on aggressive solicitation. Cafes bent on scamming are being closely monitored, and city officials hope to institute a cap on the number of downscale chains on the strip. Jessica Robinson, who sat outside Mangoโ€s Tropical Cafรฉ, where women in feathers performed in a Latin cabaret show atop a small stage, said she lived a few blocks away and usually avoided Ocean Drive. She came on a recent weekend with her Brazilian father, who was in town. โ€I donโ€t like it. Itโ€s crowded itโ€s overrated,โ€ Ms. Robinson said, gesturing toward the surge of people jostling past a thicket of umbrellas and tables. โ€My father just saw someone trying to pickpocket a bag. โ€ Upset for years now, Mr. Novick started posting clips of the crassness on his YouTube channel, I Love Miami Beach, and Facebook page, South Beach Sludge Report. โ€International tourists who used to come here in droves avoid this place like the plague,โ€ Mr. Novick said, adding that people who stay in Ocean Drive hotels complain incessantly about noise. โ€Noise is what fuels all of the riffraff. They need to take the party off the street. โ€ Mayor Philip Levine says he has heard it all before. Last year, he tried to move last call to 2 a. m. from 5 a. m. which panicked owners of restaurants and businesses on the strip. A compromise emerged: The city steered more money to the Miami Beach Police Department, which added 12 police officers to the area. The officers sit under towering lights that span the most problematic three blocks of Ocean Drive, from Eighth Street to 11th Street, making them hard to miss. A strategy to help the homeless in the area is also now in place. The police chief, Daniel J. Oates, said that crime in the area had dropped but that a couple of highly visible murders made the problem seem worse than it was. โ€Many times these days, if someone is committing a street crime, we are catching the person in the act 50 percent of the robberies, we caught the guy immediately,โ€ he said. โ€Thatโ€s phenomenal, to catch them in the act before they leave the scene. โ€ Ocean Drive is usually at one end or the other of a    cycle. For decades up until the late 1980s, it became a favored spot for   retirees and those on fixed incomes they gossiped as they sat on plastic chairs on the hotelsโ€ front porches and looked at the ocean. Then the hotels fell into disrepair. After the 1980 Mariel boatlift  โ€”   an exodus of 125, 000 Cubans to Florida  โ€”   many of the criminals whom Fidel Castro had released from prison and sent to Miami flocked to the neighborhood, and crime spiked. In the late 1980s, after preservationists saved a number of buildings from demolition and fought to create a preservation district, the neighborhood made a flashy comeback that attracted celebrities. Gloria Estefan invested in a hotel on Ocean Drive and a restaurant. Gianni Versace moved into his    mansion at 1116 Ocean Drive (and was gunned down on its steps in 1997 by a serial killer). Television shows like โ€Miami Viceโ€ couldnโ€t resist the natural light, the beach, the sky and the architecture.   models flocked here. Carefree from the start, the scene was louche, and its seedy nature was seen as a key ingredient of its cool charm. Beyond the     party scene, some restaurants and hotels, like the Betsy, cater to a more upscale crowd. โ€People are making money, and people are coming here,โ€ said Mike Palma, the executive vice president of Brio Investment Group, which oversees the always crowded Clevelander Hotel. โ€People just experience more negative things on Ocean Drive than in the past. โ€ Mr. Novick said he feared the cityโ€s plan of action was a โ€fundamentally flawedโ€ parade of   that would ultimately fail. In his view, the chaos is a byproduct of too much binge drinking in the wee hours, which is why he believes last call should be moved to 2 a. m. โ€Nothing good happens on Miami Beach after 2 a. m.,โ€ he said. โ€In recent months, itโ€s been shootings, fights, brutal attacks and armed robberies. โ€ Not everyone is concerned. At the Clevelander, which features   dancers on its roof and   music, Tiffany Chalothorn, 26, an actress from New York, sipped tequila with two friends. She had no complaints, she said: The weather was balmy, music by Pitbull was beckoning on the dance floor, and the scene seemed far from threatening. โ€Are you kidding?โ€ she said. โ€New York is so much crazier than this. โ€",0
